This app built on flask turns multiple text fields into a blog and podcast by
implementing Azure's Text to Speach SDK for life-like neural voices, combined
with music, to create an audio file that is uploaded to a s3 bucket.

I use PodGen to create an rss.xml then Flask Frozen to create a static version that
is deployed on a git push to a Cloud Flare Page

To get started you'll need add 3 files to a .secret directory in the root folder
azure.json
{
  "subscription": "d4fxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxf",
  "region": "northus"
  }

.s3.json
{
  "url": "https://<s3bucketurl>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com",
  "bucket": "<name of bucket>",
  "access_key_id": "<access id>>",
  "access_key_secret": "<access secret>"
  }

spin up sqlite database in "instance"
$flask db-init

java -jar tika-server-1.24.jar


then run app
$flask --app doc_blog --debug run
