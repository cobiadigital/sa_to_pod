He moved to Kentucky in 1785 or 1786 and gained a reputation as a greater preacher than his brothers Joseph and Lewis, who were also Baptist pioneers there. Elijah\xe2\x80\x99s preaching voice was \xe2\x80\x9clike the loud sound of a sweet trumpet\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9ccommonly brought many tears from the hearers\xe2\x80\x9d and converted many. He was also an entrepreneur: he built Kentucky\xe2\x80\x99s first sawmill, made rope, fulled cloth, and founded a bourbon distillery around 1789. He was known for church controversies and spent most of his money chasing after new business ventures, leaving his family poor when he died in May 1808. Yet the <span class="italic">Kentucky Gazette</span> eulogized him: \xe2\x80\x9cIf virtue consists in being useful to our fellow citizens, perhaps there were few more virtuous men than Mr. Craig.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en2" href="part0020.html#ch01en2e">2</a></span> At least in the early nineteenth century, distilling bourbon was a mark of virtue for a Baptist minister.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Elijah Craig\xe2\x80\x99s story illustrates how some pious southerners in the nineteenth century saw no need to choose between liquor and the Lord. Even strict Baptists tolerated crafting, selling, and drinking high-proof distilled beverages, to say nothing of fermented beverages such as wine and beer with less alcoholic content. Permissive attitudes to intoxicating drinks persisted amid early nineteenth-century revivals, commonly called the Second Great Awakening, and most southerners carried these views with them to the late nineteenth century. This permissive attitude toward alcohol stretched back much further than the colonial era; it continued a millennia-long Judeo-Christian tradition of appreciation for both common and consecrated drinks.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Traditional Christian attitudes towards alcoholic beverages tended to oppose prohibition in four areas. While classical Christian views of temperance meant moderate use, prohibitionists\xe2\x80\x99 insistence on total abstinence from alcohol more closely followed Islamic teaching. Passages of the Bible also supported moderate alcohol use, particularly regarding wine. The celebration of Christian communion had always involved sacred wine until the nineteenth-century innovation of grape juice. And early American views on Christian liberty, particularly in the South, emphasized limited government and anticlerical politics.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Church structure mattered in these debates. Top-down Methodists tended to be more united, better organized, and earlier supporters of prohibition than bottom-up Baptists. Theology also mattered. \xe2\x80\x9cHigh church\xe2\x80\x9d groups such as Catholics, Episcopalians, and Lutherans tended to defer to traditional readings favoring wine in communion and at home, while relatively \xe2\x80\x9clow church\xe2\x80\x9d denominations such as Baptists, Methodists, and Presbyterians were more likely to defy ancient tradition and embrace theological novelties such as prohibition.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The American transformation from traditional views on temperance, the Bible, communion, and liberty to the modern innovation of prohibition was facilitated by a remarkable shift in how American Christians derived their spiritual authority from a common-sense, republican, individualist reading of the Bible. As changing circumstances and modern science revealed new threats from alcohol abuse, many American Christians used Scripture to defend a totalistic rejection of alcoholic drinks. They argued for alcohol abstinence on the grounds of experience, expediency, and proper application of general Christian principles, though even some prohibitionists admitted that the Bible did not forbid drinking as such. Other Christians deployed the Bible to defend a more traditional view that alcohol was not evil but was a gift of God.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Christian Temperance</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Wets claimed that totalistic opposition to alcohol, whether through teetotalism or prohibition, undermined traditional Christian teaching that moderate use promoted morality better than total abstinence. \xe2\x80\x9cTemperance\xe2\x80\x9d had throughout Christian history been understood not as abstinence from alcohol but as the moderate use of pleasure. Only in modern times did temperance take on a connection with alcohol. Following Aristotle\xe2\x80\x99s notion of finding virtue between two extremes, ancient and medieval theologians developed articulations of Christian virtue that rested between the extreme vices of excess and deficiency. For such theologians and philosophers, temperance lay between the excess of self-indulgence, which was common and dangerous, and the deficiency of shunning pleasure, which was so rare in Aristotle\xe2\x80\x99s time that he invented a name for it: \xe2\x80\x9cinsensibility.\xe2\x80\x9d The great medieval Catholic theologian Thomas Aquinas explicitly tackled the issue of whether shunning pleasure could be considered a vice and concluded that abstinence could be praiseworthy or necessary in certain circumstances for the sake of physical or spiritual health, but even so pleasure ought not to be shunned altogether.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en3" href="part0020.html#ch01en3e">3</a></span> Translating the virtue to alcohol use, self-indulgence meant drunkenness, insensibility meant abstinence, and temperance meant moderate drinking.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Given this long-standing understanding of temperance, prohibition would have seemed absurd to Americans before the nineteenth century. Even the exacting Pilgrims and Puritans of seventeenth-century New England had no problem with fermented spirits; the Mayflower was well-stocked with them. The Puritan Francis Higginson sailed for Massachusetts Bay in 1629 with forty-five casks of beer and twenty gallons of brandy for his Puritan relatives and community, and Jonathan Edwards\xe2\x80\x99s father enjoyed an ordination party in 1698 provisioned with four quarts of rum and eight quarts of wine. Increase Mather preached that \xe2\x80\x9cwine is from God\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cthe drunkard is from the Devil.\xe2\x80\x9d Historian Mark Noll notes that some scholars think Increase\xe2\x80\x99s son Cotton Mather coined the phrase, but if so, he was echoing Increase\xe2\x80\x99s words from 1673: \xe2\x80\x9cDrink is in itself a creature from God, and to be received with thankfulness.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en4" href="part0020.html#ch01en4e">4</a></span> Early Americans followed classical Christian theology to argue that alcoholic beverages were God-given, so insisting upon complete abstinence was not virtue but vice.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">If early Puritans in colonial New England could and did distinguish alcohol\xe2\x80\x99s good and evil uses, the denizens of the US South had even fewer qualms about alcohol. Even by the accounts of Ernest Cherrington, a prolific researcher for the Anti-Saloon League, colonial Americans had \xe2\x80\x9cno condemnation of intoxicating liquors as such,\xe2\x80\x9d and even though use of alcoholic drinks \xe2\x80\x9cincreased by leaps and bounds,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cmoral and religious forces\xe2\x80\x9d of the day had \xe2\x80\x9cno attitude of hostility to intoxicants,\xe2\x80\x9d but only against drunkenness.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en5" href="part0020.html#ch01en5e">5</a></span> Indeed, liquors \xe2\x80\x9cin themselves were considered wholesome and necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d and when taken in \xe2\x80\x9cmoderation . . . were considered helpful and stimulating.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en6" href="part0020.html#ch01en6e">6</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">This classical notion of temperance enjoyed widespread acceptance by American Christians until the early nineteenth century, when alcoholism in the United States reached epidemic proportions. Advances in distilling technology, the profitability of converting grain crops into alcoholic beverages, the replacement of milder beverages like beer and cider with stronger drinks like whiskey, and social acceptance of heavier drinking was turning the United States after the Revolution into the \xe2\x80\x9cAlcohol Republic,\xe2\x80\x9d as historian W. J. Rorabaugh put it. By 1830, an average American over fifteen years old drank eighty-eight bottles of whiskey annually, nearly three times the average today. Drinking became synonymous with drunkenness. These excesses prompted reformers like Lyman Beecher to form in 1826 the American Temperance Society (ATS) and to spearhead a national temperance movement against the destructive influences of alcohol. Temperance advocates initially preferred moral suasion to combat the evils of demon rum. The Virginia ATS chapter in 1827, for example, denounced the \xe2\x80\x9cintemperate use of spirituous liquors\xe2\x80\x9d but did not call for total abstinence, much less for prohibition.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en7" href="part0020.html#ch01en7e">7</a></span> Prohibitionists, however, insisted upon wielding the moral force of the state to eliminate the very temptation to drink by outlawing the production and sale of alcohol.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en8" href="part0020.html#ch01en8e">8</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Why did prohibitionists break with Christian tradition by adopting such a radical approach of not only abstinence, but legal prohibition? The answer lies in part in the changes in religious sensibilities between the American Revolution and the Civil War. During that time, most Protestants in the United States increasingly based their faith on individualistic, republican, and common-sense readings of the Bible. This new consensus replaced more traditional Christian views (even among Protestants) that revered community authority, expert exegesis, and hierarchy. Mark Noll, Nathan O. Hatch, and others have observed that this alliance between representative government and Christianity was by no means obvious or natural but was remarkably innovative for a faith that had been defined through hierarchical relationships and community consensus. In short, most American Protestants had already broken dramatically with Christian tradition by aligning it to individualistic common sense, which made it more likely for American Christians to adopt innovations that were unconnected or even opposed to classical Christian teachings, including alcohol abstinence and prohibition.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en9" href="part0020.html#ch01en9e">9</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Various learned laymen across the nation took up the pen to expose prohibition as an innovation that had more to do with legalistic Islam than with classic Christianity. In 1867, John A. Andrew of Boston spoke out at a public forum against \xe2\x80\x9cthose who would rest the hopes of humanity on the commandments of men\xe2\x80\x9d such as prohibition and pointed instead to \xe2\x80\x9cthe promises of Gospel Grace\xe2\x80\x9d as the effective means to live truly temperate lives. He also pointed to the positive reforms of England in that century, citing the people\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c[r]eligious faith, Christian charity, philanthropic benevolence,\xe2\x80\x9d and other virtues in all levels of society, which \xe2\x80\x9cnow battle effectually against the vices of society, and the evil inclinations of human nature.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThis progress,\xe2\x80\x9d he claimed, \xe2\x80\x9cwas not Jewish, nor Mohammedan, but it was Christian. It was not due to law, but to liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d He believed the most effective way of combating vice among all classes was Christian faith and virtue stemming from liberty, not the legalism he saw in other religions.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en10" href="part0020.html#ch01en10e">10</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Some Christians in the South shared this perception. Alexander Watkins Terrell, a Texas state senator who later became a chief architect of the state\xe2\x80\x99s dry poll-tax law, also denounced prohibition in 1879. On the one hand, he claimed that centuries of Islamic prohibition on alcohol led to the gradual \xe2\x80\x9cphysical and moral decay\xe2\x80\x9d of the Turks. On the other hand, he objected to banning wine, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich the Savior himself once made by his miraculous power, to cheer the heart of a bridegroom and his guests, and against the temperate use of which He never uttered a word during all his pilgrimage on earth.\xe2\x80\x9d For Terrell and his constituents, temperate alcohol use was on the side of Jesus and freedom, while prohibitionists were on the side of Muhammad and regression.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en11" href="part0020.html#ch01en11e">11</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-a">The Bible and Booze</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">As Terrell\xe2\x80\x99s reference to Jesus turning water into wine in John 2 indicated, wets could cite the Bible for their cause just as well as, if not better than, their dry opponents. This seems to challenge Mark Noll\xe2\x80\x99s observation that popular recourse to the Bible as authoritative for a major US political crisis occurred for the last time regarding slavery. The dominant approach in that theological and moral debate was a common-sense hermeneutic that valued individuals\xe2\x80\x99 interpretations of the Bible over church tradition and magisterial authority, which left only the violence of the Civil War as a viable option to overcome the impasse over slavery.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en12" href="part0020.html#ch01en12e">12</a></span> Following the conflict, ordinary people in the United States displaced debates over Bible passages from the public discourse because, without recourse to an outside authority like church tradition, it was open to conflicting interpretations and so failed to provide the means to resolve the issue of slavery apart from devastating Civil War.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en13" href="part0020.html#ch01en13e">13</a></span> When it came to prohibition, however, both drys and wets freely wielded the Bible for their cause, suggesting that the Bible still carried weight in the postbellum United States.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The American prohibition movement sprang not from literal interpretations of the Bible but from Americans\xe2\x80\x99 experience. Drinking became a serious problem for many churches around the nation after the Civil War, but most Southern Baptists did not immediately call for prohibition, even if they did recommend abstinence from alcohol. The official newspaper of the Baptist General Association of Virginia recommended in October of 1865 that only teetotalism could prevent drunkenness, but five years later admitted that such behavior was not demanded by the Bible: \xe2\x80\x9cTotal abstinence from intoxicating liquors, with certain limitations, is commended by expediency, the experience of multitudes, the opinion of many wise and good men, and by a fair application of certain scriptural principles.\xe2\x80\x9d Still, they admitted \xe2\x80\x9cthe Bible contains no prohibition of the use of wine and strong drink, and all attempts to draw such a prohibition from it is a perversion of Scripture, and injurious to the cause which it is intended to subserve.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en14" href="part0020.html#ch01en14e">14</a></span> In 1870, Southern Baptists had not yet claimed the Bible directly supported alcohol abstinence, much less prohibition.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Skepticism about the wisdom of using the Bible to insist on abstinence persisted among Southern Baptists until the 1880s. A few voices in major Baptist periodicals argued for moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages, including hard liquor, as late as 1884. After a consensus emerged that distilled liquors were unacceptable drinks for serious Christians, some Baptists continued to suggest that the best antidote for intemperance was moderate consumption of wine, beer, cider, and other malt drinks that occurred naturally and featured less alcoholic content. Even these modest allowances were frequently countered by observations that excessive drinking of any alcoholic beverage could easily lead to drunkenness.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en15" href="part0020.html#ch01en15e">15</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The hardest drink habit for Southern Baptists to kick was wine. Many southerners considered wine the most innocuous of alcoholic beverages. Farm columns in Baptist journals such as the Atlanta <span class="italic">Christian Index</span> included wine recipes and encouragement to produce diversified crops for the manufacture of wines from various fruits, including blackberries, strawberries, and scuppernongs.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en16" href="part0020.html#ch01en16e">16</a></span> Baptist writers also acknowledged that wine was encouraged in the Bible. St. Paul urged his prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 in 1 Timothy 5:23 to \xe2\x80\x9ctake a little wine\xe2\x80\x9d for his health, and Jesus famously turned water into wine in a wedding in John 2. \xe2\x80\x9cWe fully believe,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote one contributor to the Richmond, Virginia, <span class="italic">Religious Herald </span>in 1879, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the wine made by Christ at the marriage in Cana was intoxicating, if drunk to excess.\xe2\x80\x9d Another stated, \xe2\x80\x9cThat Christ drank wine during His stay on earth, no one can doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en17" href="part0020.html#ch01en17e">17</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Nonetheless, many Southern Baptists insisted upon shunning wine despite the examples in the Bible because they interpreted their faith according to a common-sense understanding of their own times. Baptist icon John A. Broadus of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary granted that Jesus used wine in the first century but claimed that Christ only drank it because of cultural custom. Had Jesus lived in the present, Broadus insisted, he would have shunned wine and preferred more respectable drinks like tea or coffee. A Virginian editor in 1888 urged teetotalers: if they would focus on \xe2\x80\x9cpresent facts and present dangers\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cabandon all attempts to find an explicit Bible command, what a relief it would be to them and to the cause!\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en18" href="part0020.html#ch01en18e">18</a></span> By the 1890s, Southern Baptists had hardened their views against alcohol as the greatest vice, though this view sprang from experience rather than the Bible. The Florida Baptist Convention called alcohol the most \xe2\x80\x9cdestructive curse of the 19th century, imperiling our homes, hostile to our churches, a constant menace to society, the prolific mother of vice and crime, the corrupter of politics, a breeder of anarchy in our government, and in all its dark record the offspring of the devil.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en19" href="part0020.html#ch01en19e">19</a></span> For Southern Baptist drys in the late nineteenth century, appeals to common sense and present realities trumped clear biblical examples condoning alcohol consumption.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Methodists banned alcohol consumption before Baptists, though experience and reason had more to do with the proscription than Scripture or tradition. John Wesley established the rule forbidding \xe2\x80\x9cDrunkenness, or drinking spirituous liquors unless in cases of necessity,\xe2\x80\x9d for his followers in the eighteenth century. While British Methodists threatened to ban members for drinking liquor as early as 1795, American Methodists\xe2\x80\x99 book of discipline in use at that time did not mention drinking, though it did banish people who talked before church. By the 1870s, however, the white-led Southern Methodist and Northern Methodist denominations both included the rule against drunkenness and distilled drinks. Even then, \xe2\x80\x9cspiritous liquors\xe2\x80\x9d meant distilled beverages and excluded fermented drinks with lower alcoholic content such as beer and wine.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en20" href="part0020.html#ch01en20e">20</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">In the nineteenth century, white and Black American Methodists began to embrace alcohol abstinence and then prohibition. The African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), the first major Black denomination in the United States, had since the 1830s taught abstinence from all kinds of alcohol and since the 1850s backed prohibition laws to purify society at large.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en21" href="part0020.html#ch01en21e">21</a></span> By 1883, the main white Methodist group, the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (MECS), began treating not only drinking but also the production and sale of alcohol\xe2\x80\x94and soon even renting property to those in the alcohol trade\xe2\x80\x94as an evil worthy of church discipline.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en22" href="part0020.html#ch01en22e">22</a></span> These standards stemmed more from evolving understandings of the dangers of alcohol than the teachings of Scripture.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Dry organizations such as the Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) invoked the Bible freely to support their mission. A typical state-conference report of the Texas WCTU reveals the organization\xe2\x80\x99s heavy use of a common-sense evangelical approach to the Bible not only in rhetoric but in regular functions. The second page provides the \xe2\x80\x9cWCTU Benediction,\xe2\x80\x9d an exact quote of the Aaronic Blessing from Number 6:24\xe2\x80\x9326.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en23" href="part0020.html#ch01en23e">23</a></span> The use of these verses as the WCTU Benediction suggests their ritualistic function in concluding all manner of events by officially invoking God\xe2\x80\x99s presence and aid through the unambiguous use of the Bible as Scripture.

Frances E.

She attributed her support for \xe2\x80\x9cHome Protection,\xe2\x80\x9d or women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage, as a means to support prohibition, to a direct revelation from God: \xe2\x80\x9cUpon my knees there was borne in upon my mind from loftier regions, the declaration, you are to speak for the woman\xe2\x80\x99s ballot as a weapon of protection to her home.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en26" href="part0020.html#ch01en26e">26</a></span> For Willard and likeminded evangelical women, God granted them spiritual authority and wisdom to defend their God-given roles as women and mothers through political activism.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en27" href="part0020.html#ch01en27e">27</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The Texas WCTU\xe2\x80\x99s presidential address portrayed their fight as a simple matter of good against evil.

This thesis claimed that the Bible referred two kinds of wine: a nonalcoholic wine for all positive references, and an alcoholic wine for all negative references. Hundreds of educated American clergy around the nation objected to the two-wine thesis in 1888, including the Rev. Edward Hurtt Jewett. Using references to the original Hebrew and Greek texts of the Bible, Jewett argued that \xe2\x80\x9cthe term <span class="italic">unfermented</span> wine, in Scripture phraseology, is a misnomer and self-contradictory,\xe2\x80\x9d since wine was always presumed to have been fermented.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en31" href="part0020.html#ch01en31e">31</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Some years later, Edward R.

His first defense notes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Bible in unmistakable language commended wine,\xe2\x80\x9d yet the innovation of anti-alcohol asceticism produced the two-wine argument.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en32" href="part0020.html#ch01en32e">32</a></span> Emerson claimed that, in making this distinction, \xe2\x80\x9cReason, science, and the teachings of two thousand years were to fall apart as if cut with knives.\xe2\x80\x9d In place of reason and tradition, \xe2\x80\x9cLinguistic legerdemain has been indulged in to such an extent that even many of the most watchful have failed to see the glaring absurdity and utter ridiculousness of the name they have chosen for their wine,\xe2\x80\x9d namely \xe2\x80\x9cunfermented wine.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en33" href="part0020.html#ch01en33e">33</a></span> Drinking fermented wine, Emerson noted, was ubiquitous among the ancient Israelites and their neighboring nations.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en34" href="part0020.html#ch01en34e">34</a></span> He also noted that, throughout the Bible, the typical Hebrew and Greek words for wine (<span class="italic">yayin</span> and <span class="italic">oinos</span>) are always spoken of as \xe2\x80\x9ca blessing sent by God for the use of man\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cto be used in the service of God,\xe2\x80\x9d such as in Isaiah 55:1\xe2\x80\x932, where the word functions \xe2\x80\x9cas a symbol of the highest spiritual blessing.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en35" href="part0020.html#ch01en35e">35</a></span> Other Hebrew and Greek words for wine, such as <span class="italic">\xe2\x80\x99asis</span> (Isaiah 49:26), <span class="italic">tirosh</span> (Hosea 4:11), and <span class="italic">gleukos</span> (Acts 2:13), all imply intoxication, and no word for wine in the Bible ever refers to a nonalcoholic beverage.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en36" href="part0020.html#ch01en36e">36</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Emerson continued his reasoning with reference to many other Bible passages that referred to wine positively. The Bible \xe2\x80\x9cplainly said that Christ made wine\xe2\x80\x9d in John 2.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en37" href="part0020.html#ch01en37e">37</a></span> He refuted those who interpreted Jesus\xe2\x80\x99s parable of new wine into old bottles as a parable against fermented wine, pointing out that there is no basis in the text for such an interpretation, and the parable only makes sense if the wine in question is fermented.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en38" href="part0020.html#ch01en38e">38</a></span> Jesus himself was derided by his detractors as having come \xe2\x80\x9cdrinking wine\xe2\x80\x9d in Luke 7:33\xe2\x80\x9334, a fact to which Emerson attached great theological importance: \xe2\x80\x9cJesus was no ascetic.

By drinking wine\xe2\x80\x94freely using the blessings of God\xe2\x80\x99s providence\xe2\x80\x94He testified against the error, afterward called Gnostic and Manichean, which would attach impurity to that which enters the mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d Furthermore, Jesus thus \xe2\x80\x9cvindicated the liberty of His followers to use \xe2\x80\x98every creature of God\xe2\x80\x99 as good and fit for food, and to be received with thanksgiving by them as those who \xe2\x80\x98believe and know the truth,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d a direct reference to 1 Timothy 4:3\xe2\x80\x934.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en39" href="part0020.html#ch01en39e">39</a></span> Rather than merely arguing that the Bible allows and blesses alcoholic beverages, Emerson contended that prohibition went against the essence of Christian liberty as articulated in the Bible and Christian tradition. Emerson and likeminded wets avoided the extreme of prohibition not merely because they professed fidelity to the plain meaning of the text, but because they\xe2\x80\x94unlike prohibitionists\xe2\x80\x94refused to separate Bible interpretation from the church\xe2\x80\x99s tradition and ethics.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Among Southern Baptists, this two-wine argument raged especially between 1887 and 1890 and then abruptly ceased to attract significant debate. This debate on Bible wines either waned in 1890 because prohibitionists had won or, more likely, because Baptists agreed to disagree and focus on more important matters, since the debate over prohibition was not resolved in the SBC until 1896.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en40" href="part0020.html#ch01en40e">40</a></span> Wets like Jewett and Emerson interpreted the Bible through philology and history, yet they also argued from a plain reading of the Bible according to church tradition and common sense. Prohibitionists also appealed to philology and history to reinterpret the Bible, but the argument mattered only because many on both sides viewed the Bible as Scripture.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">However, some nineteenth-century prohibitionists publicly rejected the Bible as Scripture, including Elizabeth Cady Stanton. An early advocate for prohibition, Stanton turned away from evangelical Christianity before reaching adulthood. By the 1890s, Stanton grew convinced that Christianity and the Bible were inimical to gender equality and had to be confronted. She initiated the <span class="italic">Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Bible,</span> a collaborative project in which she and other women offered commentary on Bible passages that dealt directly with women, especially those used by opponents of gender equality. Consequently, she and other religious radicals were marginalized from both the suffrage and temperance movements by the end of the nineteenth century. Nonetheless, the fact that heterodox women such as Stanton had played key roles in the earlier temperance movement suggested their continued presence in the movement in years to come.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en41" href="part0020.html#ch01en41e">41</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Prohibitionists who invoked the Bible differed on how literally to interpret it and on whether prohibition was primarily about saving individual souls or redeeming society. Temperance literature in the nineteenth century often contained variants of, \xe2\x80\x9cNo drunkard . . . shall inherit the kingdom of God,\xe2\x80\x9d from 1 Corinthians 6:10,<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en42" href="part0020.html#ch01en42e">42</a></span> and a few leading drys repeated this claim in the twentieth century. Ferdinand Iglehart dedicated his celebration of prohibition, <span class="italic">King Alcohol Dethroned,</span> to the salvation of souls: \xe2\x80\x9cThis book goes out with the hope that it may reclaim some drunkard . . . that some soul may be saved for time and eternity.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en43" href="part0020.html#ch01en43e">43</a></span> However, this fear of hell was not shared by progressive prohibitionists such as the modernist Presbyterian Charles Stelzle, who took a leading role in the Social Gospel movement to reform society according to Christian principles and modern scientific management. In his defense of dry laws, <span class="italic">Why Prohibition!,</span> Stelzle mocked the idea of people going to hell as something the fundamentalist revivalist \xe2\x80\x9cBilly Sunday says.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en44" href="part0020.html#ch01en44e">44</a></span> Thus, Christian prohibitionists were divided between fundamentalists like Sunday, whose concern to save souls through prohibition was rooted in a common-sense evangelical interpretation of the Bible, and modernists like Stelzle, who mocked their concern and shunned such a literal reading of Scripture.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The Bible could and did play on both sides of the prohibition divide, though some prohibitionists treated it as peripheral or nonessential to their cause while anti-prohibitionists at times invoked the Bible more effectively. Baptists sometimes admitted that one could not reasonably argue for prohibition from the Bible and that Jesus drank and made wine. Only by applying contemporary culture and experiences could Christians conclude that alcohol must be shunned. Christians on both sides often resorted to extra-biblical arguments rather than trusting Scripture alone to resolve the issue. Whether supported by the Bible or not, once prohibitionists viewed alcohol as evil, the struggle expanded beyond prohibition to the question of wine in communion.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Communion Wine</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">On Christmas Day 1838, in the Masonic Lodge of Matagorda, the first Episcopalian Eucharist in the Republic of Texas was celebrated. The priest, Fr.

The Christian tradition of wine in the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Supper derived from the Jewish custom of Seder dinner, with its four cups of wine. Since at least the first century, ancient Christians began meeting together over bread and wine. The tradition gradually transitioned from a \xe2\x80\x9clove feast\xe2\x80\x9d meal to a highly structured ritual in which a priest distributed wafers and sips of wine. For most medieval peasants, communion wine remained in sight but out of reach, reserved for priests. Though greatly changed, two constants remained: bread and wine.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The Reformation democratized the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Supper. The English <span class="italic">Book of Common Prayer</span> made worship more accessible in many ways: services were in the English vernacular, the altar became a table closer to the people, and everyone was encouraged to partake of both bread and wine weekly. Ironically, even as Protestant doctrine made the Eucharist more accessible, Protestant anxiety about taking the Eucharist improperly led to communion becoming less frequent and less important in Protestant worship just as the Council of Trent ordered every faithful Catholic to partake in communion at each mass.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en47" href="part0020.html#ch01en47e">47</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The centuries-old assumptions that communion should feature fermented wine came under attack in innovative America. In 1869, a British-born Wesleyan Methodist named Thomas Bramwell Welch invented a pasteurization method to prevent the fermentation of grape juice. Though other methods previously existed to create nonalcoholic grape juice, and Welch\xe2\x80\x99s own Wesleyan Methodist denomination had explicitly required nonalcoholic wine for communion since 1843, Welch\xe2\x80\x99s method could produce higher-quality juice in larger quantities than other techniques. Welch encouraged churches to use his \xe2\x80\x9cunfermented wine,\xe2\x80\x9d and his sales increased commensurately with the growing popularity of prohibition.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en48" href="part0020.html#ch01en48e">48</a></span> As the nineteenth century closed, more American Christians came to believe that personal experience, common sense, and modern science were incompatible with the doctrine that alcoholic beverages should be used in the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Supper. As Jennifer L. Woodruff Tait<span class="superscript"> </span>argues, the move to replace communion wine with grape juice among Methodists represented \xe2\x80\x9cthe natural result of applying the common-sense worldview to the temperance problem.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en49" href="part0020.html#ch01en49e">49</a></span> Some churches forsook alcohol while others revered it. These divides over alcohol suggested that the historical peculiarities of denominations and theological traditions affected their approach to the issue of communion wine. Since Tait has provided an excellent description of these shifts in Methodist churches, much of the following analysis will focus on a few other Christian groups, starting with Baptists.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Some Baptists preferred to keep alcohol in their sacred wine. From 1886 to 1890, the main argument among Baptists had shifted from whether alcoholic beverages were generally permissible (they were not) to whether they should use wine or grape juice in communion. Though Baptists viewed communion as an ordinance, or command to be followed, rather than a sacrament, or a means of God\xe2\x80\x99s grace, they took ordinances seriously. The very name \xe2\x80\x9cBaptist\xe2\x80\x9d referred to their only other ordinance, baptism, on which they staked their denominational identity. Since Baptists insisted upon the biblical model of baptism\xe2\x80\x94full immersion for believing adults only\xe2\x80\x94how could they justify using anything other than wine for communion? \xe2\x80\x9cIf we must have real water for baptism and not some substitute for it,\xe2\x80\x9d a Baptist from Florida asked, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy not have real wine for the supper?\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en50" href="part0020.html#ch01en50e">50</a></span> Another insisted that replacing communion wine with grape juice was just as absurd as \xe2\x80\x9csubstitut[ing] sprinkling for baptism\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a violation of <span class="italic">the</span> Baptist distinctive.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en51" href="part0020.html#ch01en51e">51</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Ironically, those who contended most firmly for baptism by immersion also tended to be those who insisted upon replacing wine with grape juice. To hold their view with any consistency, prohibitionists who claimed \xe2\x80\x9cliteralist\xe2\x80\x9d views of the Bible fiercely advocated the two-wine thesis. This theory essentially argued that all the Bible\xe2\x80\x99s positive references to wine were to nonalcoholic juice while all the negative references were to alcoholic wine. Wets like Edward R. Emerson claimed that partaking of wine in communion was \xe2\x80\x9cthe most sacred and solemn act that a human being can perform.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en52" href="part0020.html#ch01en52e">52</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Other Baptist drys, less willing to resort to exegetical gymnastics, took a more \xe2\x80\x9cliberal\xe2\x80\x9d view on Bible wines. This camp included John Broadus, who admitted that all wine in the Bible was alcoholic but used reason and experience to conclude that biblical authors and figures indulged only because doing so was necessary in their culture, but they would never have partaken in modern times, when such beverages were linked with vice. For this reason, and because communion was merely symbolic and using wine would cause total abstainers to stumble in their faith, grape juice could and should be substituted for wine in communion.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en53" href="part0020.html#ch01en53e">53</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">After 1890, the argument over communion wine ceased to occupy much attention of most Southern Baptists, who largely agreed to disagree on the matter. A motion to insist on unfermented grape juice in communion at the 1891 convention of Tennessee Baptists was tabled. Various articles in Baptist journals in 1900 likewise failed to evoke responses or rejoinders. Baptists\xe2\x80\x99 congregational form of government allowed autonomy to local churches and prevented denominational leaders from dictating uniformity. Social sanctions and persuasion turned most Baptist ministers to grape juice in the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Supper by the turn of the century, yet some celebrated their freedom by persisting with wine. Rather than consuming their energy on sacred wine, Baptist leaders instead focused their attention on acting against the liquor business generally.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en54" href="part0020.html#ch01en54e">54</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">African American Baptists also divided on the issue of communion wine and embraced alcohol-free wine more slowly than their white co-religionists. Remarks in the minutes of the National Baptist Convention (NBC), the largest Black denomination (and for a time larger than the SBC), proved that many of its churches continued to use alcoholic wine in communion into the twentieth century. In their 1908 and 1909 reports, the NBC woman\xe2\x80\x99s auxiliary asked for the use of only unfermented wine in communion.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en55" href="part0020.html#ch01en55e">55</a></span> While most white Baptists had by this time either adopted grape juice in communion or made peace with those who persisted with wine, African American Baptists remained divided on communion wine into the twentieth century.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Some Catholics, on the other hand, insisted on Eucharistic wine to <span class="italic">enable</span> alcoholic abstinence. Official records of the Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America (CTAU), founded in 1872, called for abstinence from alcohol, but encouraged regular use of the sacraments\xe2\x80\x94including the wine-bearing Eucharist. J. B. Purcell, the first US bishop personally committed to total alcohol abstinence, emphasized that one could remain abstinent only by \xe2\x80\x9cthe frequent use of the Sacraments,\xe2\x80\x9d and other priests with similar advice appeared frequently in CTAU records.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en56" href="part0020.html#ch01en56e">56</a></span> For Catholics, who believed in transubstantiation, Eucharistic wine was not wine in substance, but transformed into the blood of Christ. For such Catholics, doing away with wine in communion did not help but rather would hinder the cause of abstinence, because the Eucharistic wine was an essential part of their connection with God in Christ, and that connection was necessary for their sobriety.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Columbia University professor John Erskine expressed an objection to nonalcoholic communion wine typical of high-church traditions: if the Eucharist with bread and wine was a central Christian practice, then taking away wine diminished that practice. The essence of Christian faith for Erskine was expressed in the \xe2\x80\x9cbeautiful metaphors\xe2\x80\x9d of Christ from the Gospel of John\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI am the Bread of Life\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI am the true Vine\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and there was no better way to express that truth than in communion with bread and wine.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en57" href="part0020.html#ch01en57e">57</a></span> Erskine claimed that \xe2\x80\x9cprohibition by professed Christians would be impossible if their faith were still warm in the heart or clear in the head, and that it has come now only because that faith is dead.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en58" href="part0020.html#ch01en58e">58</a></span> Ministers, he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cstill read out in the churches that Christ celebrated the Passover with His disciples, with the bread and wine of the ancient sacrifice,\xe2\x80\x9d and he then quoted the related Bible passage.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en59" href="part0020.html#ch01en59e">59</a></span> By objecting \xe2\x80\x9cto the wine as improper, as a temptation and a snare,\xe2\x80\x9d they are \xe2\x80\x9cgiving up, logically if unconsciously, any further concern with the mythical or metaphysical aspects of His nature, or with that inner sustenance of which the bread and wine were to be outward or visible signs.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en60" href="part0020.html#ch01en60e">60</a></span> Such an approach simplifies Christian faith so that \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps nothing will remain of it but an ecclesiastical system or a body of ethical doctrine for such as still revere the life [of Jesus] spent in Galilee.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en61" href="part0020.html#ch01en61e">61</a></span> If the mystical and spiritual union of the believer with Christ in communion was the essence of the Christian faith, then prohibitionists were gutting the heart of Christianity.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">For Erskine, as for Emerson, prohibitionists misinterpreted not only the Bible, but the tradition of the church. Since the catechisms for Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Lutherans, and Catholics alike explicitly mentioned wine as one of the elements to be received in communion, prohibitionists should insist upon reforming their catechisms before supporting prohibition.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en62" href="part0020.html#ch01en62e">62</a></span> Only by divorcing themselves from the traditional teachings of the church could Christians devote themselves so wholeheartedly to the innovation of prohibition. If Christians could select their communion elements at will, Erskine implied, then Christians denied that those elements had any meaning apart from what the church today felt like ascribing to them. Such a faith could pick and choose its practices and doctrines at will. By removing wine from the Eucharist, prohibition proved itself not to be a form of conservative Christianity, but a thoroughly modern innovation. In short, Erskine wondered \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the Eighteenth Amendment [for federal prohibition] is an amendment to the Constitution or to the New Testament.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en63" href="part0020.html#ch01en63e">63</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-a">Christian Liberty</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">On August 15, 1885, a fifty-six-year-old Episcopalian addressed a crowd of thousands in Waco, Texas, on the evils of political preaching.

The target of his ire was the campaign\xe2\x80\x94led by prominent clergy\xe2\x80\x94to dry the area in a local option election, which he claimed would result in a union of church and state. The speaker, Richard Coke, had considerable clout: he was a current US senator, the governor who ended Reconstruction in Texas, and a Confederate veteran who had served on Jefferson Davis\xe2\x80\x99s staff.

Carroll accurately countered that southern Democrats had written the local option in the Texas Constitution of 1876; there was nothing northern about it.

Liberty became a rallying cry for anti-prohibitionist Christians in several ways. Anticlericism, or an insistence upon separation between church leaders and the state, predominated among Christians in the South. Also, many Christians had championed liberty as limited government, while drys sought to impose morality by a powerful activist government.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Several historians have traced the dominance of anticlerical views in the South through the nineteenth century. Joe Coker argues that the South initially resisted prohibition in the late nineteenth century because, among other reasons, most southern whites believed in the spirituality of the church. This doctrine insisted that churches should not address or advocate directly on political issues, including prohibition, but was overcome by dry evangelical activism from the 1880s to the 1910s, transforming the region from a wet bastion to a dry stronghold.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en67" href="part0020.html#ch01en67e">67</a></span> Joseph Locke further develops this idea, contending that activism on prohibition played a key role in reshaping the South from an anticlerical region suspicious of the union of church and state to one that revered political preaching on many issues. Notwithstanding southern white evangelical ministers\xe2\x80\x99 support for slavery, secession, the Confederacy, and the Lost Cause before prohibition, the latter issue was instrumental in creating a distinctive form of religious politics of the \xe2\x80\x9cBible Belt,\xe2\x80\x9d which did not exist until the early twentieth century.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en68" href="part0020.html#ch01en68e">68</a></span> Following Locke, Robert Wuthnow briefly contends that prohibition activism was a prominent element in empowering political preaching in the South in the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en69" href="part0020.html#ch01en69e">69</a></span> Coker studied the eastern South (Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama) while Locke and Wuthnow focused on Texas, altogether demonstrating how this religious and political transformation of the South into the Bible Belt occurred across the region around the issue of prohibition.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Episcopalians, the epitome of elite whites in both the South and the North, generally believed that preachers should stay away from politics.

That covenant was officially endorsed by the Black-led National Baptist Convention (NBC) in 1900, suggesting strong grassroots support for it in the decades leading up to that endorsement. The covenant explicitly called for members \xe2\x80\x9cto abstain from the sale and use of intoxicating drinks as a beverage.\xe2\x80\x9d However, it said nothing about prohibition laws. For many African American Baptists at the close of the nineteenth century, alcohol abstinence was a matter of personal piety and church practice, not public policy.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en72" href="part0020.html#ch01en72e">72</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">While anticlerical views reflected Protestant fears of Catholic influence, many American Catholics embraced the separation of church and politics. As a minority in a democratic society dominated by Protestants, Catholics in the United States generally sought a less intrusive government so they could work out their own salvation. Because Catholic tradition held that alcohol was not inherently sinful, Catholic temperance advocates generally preferred voluntary abstinence out of extraordinary need or piety rather than legal prohibition. Such was the norm in the largest Catholic temperance group in the nation, the Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America (CTAU). Founded in 1872 by clergy from around the nation, the CTAU was both anti-alcohol and anti-prohibition. The opening convention of the CTAU in 1872 issued an \xe2\x80\x9cAddress to the Catholics of America\xe2\x80\x9d insisting upon the motto of \xe2\x80\x9cMoral Suasion\xe2\x80\x9d while shunning \xe2\x80\x9cProhibitory laws, restrictive license systems, and special legislation against drunkenness.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en73" href="part0020.html#ch01en73e">73</a></span> At that same convention, Rev. James McDevitt of the District of Columbia argued that Catholics must work for abstinence \xe2\x80\x9con a strictly Catholic basis, discard all political considerations or means, and labor for the amelioration of the victims of intemperance through religious principles only.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en74" href="part0020.html#ch01en74e">74</a></span> Catholic religion, not political prohibition, guided Catholic temperance.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">A peculiarly Catholic element in the CTAU\xe2\x80\x99s abstinence pledge\xe2\x80\x94a requirement for all CTAU members\xe2\x80\x94was the thirst of Christ on the Cross. The pledge began: \xe2\x80\x9cI promise, with the Divine assistance and in honor of the Sacred Thirst and Agony of Our Savior, to abstain from all intoxicating drinks.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en75" href="part0020.html#ch01en75e">75</a></span> The pledge implied that, by the agonies of abstaining from drink even in moments of weakness, pledge takers relied upon Christ\xe2\x80\x99s help as they identified with his sufferings on the cross.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en76" href="part0020.html#ch01en76e">76</a></span> By 1907, the CTAU had enlisted over a 100,000 Catholics with chapters in many southern states, including Louisiana and Alabama.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en77" href="part0020.html#ch01en77e">77</a></span> Even in the Deep South, some Catholics embraced alcohol abstinence\xe2\x80\x94but through their church, not by legal prohibition through the state.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Evangelical Protestants\xe2\x80\x99 theological differences with Catholics and more liturgical Protestants influenced their views on prohibition. Evangelicals believed in a sudden conversion experience, immediate moral change, and the aspiration of ever-greater holiness for all believers. However, Catholics and more liturgical Protestants tended to view salvation as sacramental, to see holiness as the result of slow progress rather than a sudden event, and to tolerate vices such as heavier drinking habits. Attempting to impose rapid moral development on all people by strict religious laws fit better with the rapidly changing circumstances and evolving theology of American Protestants than with traditionally minded high-church Episcopalians, Lutherans, and Catholics.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en78" href="part0020.html#ch01en78e">78</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">In addition to questioning the politicization of the church for prohibition, many Christian wets in the South believed that dry laws violated their liberty by abandoning the sacrosanct principle of limited government. White southerners throughout the nineteenth century typically held to the Jeffersonian view that divisive moral issues such as alcohol were best left to individuals, families, communities, and local government rather than the state or federal government. This localist critique had roots in the American Revolution and carried weight in the South, which had fought the Civil War to protect their regional practice of slavery and long after the war invoked the rights of each state and locale to settle contentious moral issues.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The notion of limited government also had roots in classical Christian theology, which taught that individuals built righteous character by overcoming temptation through self-control, Christian community, and divine assistance. This traditional Christian position opposed prohibition, which attempted to use the state to prevent sin by removing temptation. Rather than merely exhorting parishioners to overcome bondage to drunkenness by moderate drinking or voluntary abstention, dry ministers saw demon rum as inexorable, requiring not merely individual willpower or church support but state intervention. For prohibitionists, the locus of godly social reform thus shifted from the church to the state, with the church playing a secondary role as a pressure group to ensure the progressive advancement of human morality\xe2\x80\x94not through the regeneration of souls by the power of the Holy Spirit but the coercion of bodies by the power of government. By replacing the roles of God and the church with the state, prohibition made government control all-important, turned the issue into a holy culture war that justified almost any means to achieve its end, and effectively secularized the church\xe2\x80\x99s function while attempting to sacralize the state.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s rise prompted church leaders to clamp down on dissident voices and enforce ideological uniformity on a political issue. This happened not only among Methodists, who already had a top-down structure, but increasingly among liberty-loving Baptists, who celebrated congregational autonomy and soul liberty to follow one\xe2\x80\x99s individual conscience on secondary matters. Even Baptists, who in colonial Virginia had sometimes been imprisoned for defying the Anglican establishment, sought to impose their own moral vision on the South a century later as they gained cultural and political power.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">By the 1870s, some Southern Baptists began advocating prohibition, yet they were out of step with most Baptists and Christian tradition. Baptists generally agreed that wine was permitted in the Bible and even consumed by Jesus, yet dry Baptists primarily relied on arguments from common-sense reasoning and contemporary experience. In 1875, the Baptist State Convention of Texas\xe2\x80\x99s Committee on Temperance cataloged the evils of the liquor traffic: it wasted $900 million and murdered more than sixty thousand people annually; it generated 75 percent of crime and most of the poverty and insanity; and was \xe2\x80\x9ccorrupting the ballot box,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chastening monopoly,\xe2\x80\x9d and even \xe2\x80\x9cplanting the seeds of communism.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en79" href="part0020.html#ch01en79e">79</a></span> These concerns were all contemporary and contingent\xe2\x80\x94particularly matters such as elections, monopolies, and communism\xe2\x80\x94rather than being based on eternal values from Scripture or tradition. Still, many Southern Baptists then favored moderate drinking, believed only the Gospel could cure a drunkard, and shunned politically lobbying for prohibition. Southern Methodists in the mid-1870s likewise focused more on strict abstinence among their members than in passing prohibition laws.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">White Baptist preachers defended prohibition advocacy as their Christian duty to resist evil. Responding directly to Senator Coke\xe2\x80\x99s call to put political preachers in their place, the \xe2\x80\x9cold time Baptist\xe2\x80\x9d preacher I. B. Kimbrough pronounced in 1887 at the Baptist State Convention that he would rather \xe2\x80\x9clive on corn cobs and stump water\xe2\x80\x9d than \xe2\x80\x9callow any politician to put a padlock on my mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en80" href="part0020.html#ch01en80e">80</a></span> The language inverted the wet rhetoric against political preachers as power-hungry and gave them the moral high ground as saints suffering for freedom of speech. While southern clergy asserted regional distinctiveness, their dry campaign also tied them into a national movement to advance Christian values.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The issue of prohibition also led Baptist churches to modify their traditional emphasis on congregational autonomy. Though state conventions of the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) had never before exercised authority over local congregations, according to historian Rufus Spain, various state conventions in the 1870s began threatening to cut off churches who did not properly discipline their members to avoid involvement in the alcohol trade. While Baptist churches had long since punished saloon operators and drunkards, Baptist churches began using social sanctions against those involved in the alcohol industry more generally: brewers, distillers, liquor wholesalers, or even property owners who rented land to them. Florida passed such a resolution in 1872, followed by Georgia in 1873, Texas in 1876, and Mississippi in 1878. While churches or individuals could flout them, such resolutions had an overall chilling effect on those involved in the alcohol trade. Still, in the 1870s, these were just several states in the SBC, not the whole denomination.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The turning point for white Methodists and Baptists across the South on prohibition was 1886. That year, the Methodist General Conference (Southern Methodists) denounced the manufacture and sale of alcoholic drinks as sins. After that, the denomination plunged into prohibition advocacy even as they continued using moral suasion within their churches.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en81" href="part0020.html#ch01en81e">81</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">While the Methodist hierarchy backed prohibition, some lay Methodists opposed it. Roger Quarles Mills, a Methodist from Corsicana, had been an ardent prohibitionist with his own dry monthly paper, <span class="italic">Prairie Blade.</span> One 1855 issue compared the argument that liquor is good because it brings in tax revenue to the argument that \xe2\x80\x9ca maiden should sell her virtue or a man his honesty for gold or silver.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en82" href="part0020.html#ch01en82e">82</a></span> Yet by 1887, Mills, a former US representative and future US senator, had joined the wet \xe2\x80\x9cTrue Blues,\xe2\x80\x9d contending that legal prohibition undermined Jeffersonian democracy. Mills withdrew from the Southern Methodist denomination to protest constant \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical preaching,\xe2\x80\x9d and in a debate with B. H. Carroll retorted, \xe2\x80\x9cHell is full of better preachers than that man, so full that their legs are hanging out at the windows.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en83" href="part0020.html#ch01en83e">83</a></span> While some Methodist laymen were convicted by their preachers to vote dry, others grew alienated and left because of the political preaching.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">As with Methodists, the SBC\xe2\x80\x99s first temperance resolution in 1886 was a sea change. Support for local option laws slowly morphed into support for statewide and national prohibition by the 1890s. Nonetheless, Southern Baptists did not see temperance as all-important: most denounced the Prohibition Party for undermining white supremacy by threatening the Democratic Party\xe2\x80\x99s stranglehold on the region.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en84" href="part0020.html#ch01en84e">84</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The endorsement of legal prohibition among Baptists represented a decisive shift from church-led moral suasion to state-enforced laws. As the Texas Baptists\xe2\x80\x99 Temperance Report from 1886 stated, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98moral suasion\xe2\x80\x99 has been rung in our ears so long by those who never did anything <span class="italic">for</span> moral suasion\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis original) that it \xe2\x80\x9chas ceased to be potent.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en85" href="part0020.html#ch01en85e">85</a></span> The report also noted that the government had never enforced local prohibition laws and saloon operators often flouted them\xe2\x80\x94a curious argument to lobby for <span class="italic">more</span> laws. Baptists must \xe2\x80\x9cas citizens <span class="small-caps2">VOTE</span> against this hydra-headed monster,\xe2\x80\x9d since \xe2\x80\x9cit is our duty as Christians to vote for prohibition\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfor God, and home, and native land\xe2\x80\x9d (the motto of the WCTU). If dry activism should lead to a backlash, the committee urged, \xe2\x80\x9clet us force the boycott.\xe2\x80\x9d The report then invoked Psalm 2 (\xe2\x80\x9clet the heathen rage\xe2\x80\x9d) and the Declaration of Independence (\xe2\x80\x9clet us pledge our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor\xe2\x80\x9d) to inspire their comrades against \xe2\x80\x9cthis greatest of all iniquities\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94alcohol. Texas Baptists adopted the whole report, indicating that the time for old-fashioned moral suasion was over.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en86" href="part0020.html#ch01en86e">86</a></span> Their American experience and identity had redefined the very meaning of Christian liberty.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Then in 1896, the SBC itself issued a resolution that not only endorsed prohibition, but also promised action against any Baptist who did any business with the liquor traffic. The resolution read:</p>\n<p class="x-ex-np">We announce it as the sense of this body that no person should be retained in the fellowship of a Baptist church who engages in the manufacture or sale of alcoholic liquors, either at wholesale or retail, who invests his money in the manufacture or sale of alcoholic liquors, or who rents his property to be used for distilleries, wholesale liquor houses or saloon. Nor do we believe that any church should retain in its fellowship any member who drinks intoxicating liquors as a beverage, or visits saloons or drinking places for the purpose of such indulgence.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Though the SBC had no mechanism to enforce compliance, the power of state conventions could bar individual churches from their fellowship. By 1900, every Southern Baptist state convention save North Carolina had passed similar resolutions, which pressured their churches to comply. With these declarations, prohibition advocacy became a defining issue of Southern Baptist identity. It seems fitting that the main nineteenth-century social issue on which Southern Baptists demanded new government regulations also led state conventions to exert more direct control over churches. Baptists\xe2\x80\x99 increasing advocacy for alcohol prohibition by law paralleled their diminishing tolerance of dissenting views on alcohol in church government.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en87" href="part0020.html#ch01en87e">87</a></span> Rather than pursuing anticlerical politics and limited government, white evangelicals in the South reinterpreted temperance to mean a total war against alcohol that demanded its unconditional surrender through state-mandated prohibition.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">While more traditionalist Christians favored working out their salvation apart from state interference, prohibitionists insisted that an enlarged government played a necessary part in attaining salvation from demon rum. Scholars like Richard Hamm, Ann-Marie Szymanski, and Lisa McGirr have made clear how prohibitionists contributed to the development of a more powerful federal government.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en88" href="part0020.html#ch01en88e">88</a></span> Prohibition also profoundly changed the South\xe2\x80\x99s perception of progressive, interventionist government on the state level. Despite the South\xe2\x80\x99s reputation for Jeffersonian Democracy and local rule, various scholars have pointed out how prohibition in the South was profoundly linked to the progressive movement and trademark streamlining of government. As Szymanski observed, the South grew more progressive through embracing prohibition, but she rejects the claim that the South\xe2\x80\x99s turn to progressivism came from chiefly northern influence, as William A. Link, Paul L. Harvey, and others have contended. Instead, she argues persuasively that southern progressives\xe2\x80\x99 approach to prohibition by gradual measures and local option often were more effective than more sudden and statewide approaches popular in the North. As a result, prohibition laws lasted much longer in the South than the rest of the nation. Whether or not progressivism in the South was mostly indigenous or imported, it was profoundly linked to radical changes in how southerners looked to government, from child labor laws to taxation reform. Thomas R. Pegram sums up a consensus among prohibition scholars by putting the reform at the forefront of a dramatic change for the Jeffersonian South: \xe2\x80\x9c[P]rohibition was a doorway to a host of reforms that entailed expanded state regulation over personal liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en89" href="part0020.html#ch01en89e">89</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-a">Conclusion</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Traditional Christian views on temperance, the Bible, communion wine, and liberty all resisted the American innovation of alcohol prohibition. Despite citing Scripture to suit their own purposes, drys broke with classical morality, the example of Jesus, Christian ceremonies, and American traditions to advance their novel Gospel of prohibition. The truly traditionalist Christians were not drys, but wets.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The communion wine question still divides Christians today. Millions every Sunday imbibe grape juice at communion without considering how truly modern that drink is. Given the fierce debates within Baptist and Methodist churches over the issue, it is remarkable that during national prohibition neither federal nor state governments sought to prevent the production or consumption of sacred wine. It remains an open question how much of their Christian past prohibitionists left behind when they chose the cup of Dr. Welch over the cup of their spiritual forebears.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Decades after the Civil War resolved the theological and political crisis of slavery, Christians who read the same Bible and prayed to the same God continued to deploy theology and Scripture on both sides of a culture war, this time over prohibition. White evangelical drys continued to approach the Bible the same way most US citizens did up to the Civil War: with an individualist, republican, common-sense hermeneutic. This hermeneutic democratized the interpretation of the Bible and gave readers a sense of the certainty of their readings directly with the text apart from the traditional teachings and practices of the church.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en90" href="part0020.html#ch01en90e">90</a></span> Many today still invoke Christian faith for contemporary politics, and then as now, they do so on both sides of the culture wars.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Having taken a stance against Christian tradition for prohibition, white evangelical drys throughout the South took the political offensive in the 1880s, testing their political strength for the first time through a series of statewide and local prohibition campaigns. These referenda challenged southern traditions in three other areas: race, gender, and party unity. While drys\xe2\x80\x99 early efforts to dry up the Bourbon South mostly failed, they began a movement that challenged the region\xe2\x80\x99s norms and would eventually transform it into the Bible Belt.</p>\n</body></html>\n'
