The voices taking a clear stand against pain-based collar devices and aversive control methods masquerading as dog training grow louder.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs defines <i>Standards of Care and Best Practices</i> in force-free training. Attending to animal welfare needs <i>and</i> exclusively force-free methods are setting the gold standard in emotional and behavioral modification and training. The ethical code embedded within <i>The</i> <i>Do No Harm Dog Training</i><span style=" font-style: italic; font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: super;">\xc2\xae</span><i> and Behavior Handbook </i>and the <i>Hierarchy of Dog Needs</i><span style=" font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: super;">\xc2\xae</span> (HDN) is grounded in animal welfare principles and dog-friendly dog training. By virtue of providing ethical standards and practices guidelines in the dog training field and industry, we hope to help lead the way, making life easier and more joyful for our dogs and the people who love them.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">In developing a new force-free model of best practices, we no longer leave the door open for aversive/punitive measures in dog training. The extant training models focus largely on quadrants in learning theory yet sadly, have too often been misused as a rationale and justification for the application of punitive methods in training. The ubiquitous misapplication of methods in an unregulated industry is the problem.<b> </b>Doing psychological or physical harm to a captive dog points to a lack of skill and competence on the part of the trainer. There is no justification for harsh treatment or training with dogs, or any animal for that matter, unless one\xe2\x80\x99s life or safety is in immediate danger. The methods detailed in the HDN may be used in any order without risk to the dog: <i>Do No Harm</i> methods never asks or directs the pet parent to hurt their dog psychologically or physically.<b> </b>We seek to \xe2\x80\x9cdo no harm\xe2\x80\x9d physically or psychologically to dogs under our care and training at all times.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Shock collar training is a serious animal welfare concern in the United States and across the globe. Frequently, animal abuse masquerades as dog training. How can the average pet parent be expected to make a well-informed decision with regard to behavior modification tools when so many dog trainers, misinformed professionals, and manufacturers of shock products misrepresent the true nature of their effects? There is simply no place for shock, prong, choke, or other aversive devices in companion animal training.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">In \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Shock is Not Behavior Modification,\xe2\x80\x9d principal investigator Dr. Karen Overall (2013), editor of the Journal of Veterinary Behavior states, \xe2\x80\x9cThe use of shock is not treatment for pets with behavioral concerns\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 111). The popular myth that shock \xe2\x80\x9csaves lives\xe2\x80\x9d has no evidence to support it. Indeed, nothing could be further from the truth. A hypothetical fallacy with the alternative of either shocking a dog or euthanizing a dog is a patently false dichotomy commonly posed by shock proponents. Dr. Overall states unequivocally, \xe2\x80\x9cThe use of shock does not bring dogs back from the brink of euthanasia; instead, it may send them there\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 111). Using punitive methods or devices in training can cause an increase in anxiety that often leads to further behavioral problems, resulting in pet parents relinquishing their animals to overflowing shelters. If progressive zoos are successful in changing the behavior of the animals in their care using force-free training methods alone, behavioral consultants, trainers and other professionals, ought to do the same for our pet dogs.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">In addition, dog bites are an increasingly grave public safety issue, making dog-training methods a public health concern. Bite incidents resulting from the administration of shock are not uncommon\xe2\x80\x94it is well documented in scientific literature that inflicting pain is a cause of aggressive behavior.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs has received a very positive and warm response from the dog loving community. It is in use by veterinary behaviorists, integrative and holistic veterinarians, gentle groomers, dog walkers, pet sitters and service dog organizations, trainers, and pet parents. It is designed for dog trainers teaching classes and those conducting private consultations. The infographic is particularly helpful to shelters, rescues, foster pet parents, and animal welfare advocates. It is in use as a teaching guide in colleges, on websites, on television, and by a growing, international base of pet parents interested in the <i>Do No Harm</i> ideology and practice of dog training.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Dr. Katrina Ward, DVM, remarking on her presentation of the HDN to the Australian Veterinary Association conference said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hierarchy of Dog Needs was very well received and hopefully will be taken up as a routine method of assessing needs and applying humane behavior modification\xe2\x80\x9d (as cited in Michaels, 2015/2020). Dr. Lynn Honeckman, DVM and behavior specialist in Orlando, Florida, uses the HDN to teach pre-vet students in her veterinary clinic presentations. Everyone from national crisis response human and dog trainers to working dog trainers are using it. In a television morning show featuring the Hierarchy of Dog Needs Maarja Tali, guest lecturer at Tallin University in Estonia says,</p>\n<p class="P_Block_Quote__And__Spacing_After"><i>After the basic needs are met, dogs need to feel safe and loved. Relationships are as important to dogs [as they are to humans]. So, before we start drilling or shaping or teaching or training, it is much more important that we have a good trust-based relationship with our dog. One of the most important messages here is that before we even get to training, we need to understand whether the dog is ready to learn.</i> (Tali, 2019)</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_14">How This Handbook is Organized</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent"><b>Part 1.</b> <b>The Hierarchy of Dog Needs Standards of Care and Best Force-free Practices</b> provides the theoretical foundations that support the Hierarchy of Dog Needs for each level of the pyramid and elaborates on each method of <i>Force-free Training.</i> Part 1 includes fully referenced, scientific citations for professionals and readers assuring scientific rigor. The citations enable force-free practitioners and supporters to empirically defend their stance on animal welfare needs, providing the evidence to do so at their fingertips. Part 1 is also designed for speakers, researchers, and instructors as the platform for teaching cutting edge, informative presentations based upon dog-centered needs and the <i>Hierarchy of Dog Needs/</i><i>Do No Harm</i> paradigm. The For the Pet Professional section offers various ways that pet professionals can use The Hierarchy of Dog Needs and the <i>Do No Harm </i>handbook to teach others. Pet professionals will find information on creating presentations, how to use the handbook in private consultations, how to create coursework for class curricula and ideas for using the HDN and the handbook in social media with examples that both carry the <i>Do No Harm/</i>force-free message and enhance and support business goals.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Chapter 1 discusses <i>Biological Needs</i>, including proper nutrition, the need for fresh water, sufficient and appropriate exercise, sufficient air with a focus on brachycephalic breeds, sufficient sleep, avoiding outdoor hazards with indoor shelter, and proper temperature control avoiding hyperthermia and hypothermia. Chapter 1 also illustrates the critical need for gentle grooming and gentle veterinary care. Chapter 2 address the <i>Emotional Needs</i> for security which fosters secure attachment, love, trust, consistency, and benevolent leadership. Chapter 3, <i>Social Needs</i>, explores<i> </i>bonding with people and dogs, and the purpose of play. <i>Cognitive Needs</i> detailing the relevance of choice, novelty and problem-solving activities are examined in Chapter 4.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Chapter 5,<i> Force-free Training Needs </i>defines force-free dog training and thoroughly describes the best practices listed in the Hierarchy of Dog Needs guide: Management, antecedent modification, positive reinforcement, the types of differential reinforcement, classical and counterconditioning, desensitization, the Premack Principle, and social learning are all defined and illustrated with straightforward, clear, dog-centered examples of each method.</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent_SB"><b>Part 2.</b> <b>Setting Your Dog Up for Success</b> is useful for pet professionals and pet-parents, as it lays the groundwork for success in raising a dog: Chapter 6 explores why success begins with choosing a puppy or dog that is likely to fit your lifestyle. In chapters 7\xe2\x80\x938, specific criteria are outlined to help pet parents find a competent and kind dog trainer, and to select a dog-friendly veterinarian and groomer, some of the most determinative decisions one will make in a dog\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime. Chapter 9 explains how to socialize a puppy or dog safely and carefully and how to avoid the common pitfalls of flooding puppies and rescue dogs with stimuli that can cause well-intended plans to backfire. Chapter 10 explores how and why to provide enrichment. Part 2 concludes with a discussion in Chapter 11 on the importance of learning dog body language to better understand how your dog is trying to communicate with you and others.</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent_SB"><b>Part 3.</b> <b>Good Manners and Basic Training</b> focuses on manners and training mechanics in an easy-to-learn and follow step-by-step roadmap of the nuts and bolts of teaching the basic skills everyone wants their dogs to learn. Chapter 12 explains the top ten tips for successful housetraining. Chapter 13 teaches how to replace puppy and adult dog biting, mouthing and chewing with alternate behaviors. In Chapters 14 and 15, training techniques and trainer \xe2\x80\x9csecrets\xe2\x80\x9d provide instructions for teaching dogs with the methods that successful force-free trainers use. All of the basic training needs including calm greetings, no jump, sit, down, wait, lightning recall (come) and leash-walking skills are found in Chapter 16. Part 3 includes numerous examples making sometimes complex learning principles and techniques easy for anyone to teach and understand.</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent_SB"><b>Part 4.</b> <b>When Things Go Wrong</b> addresses behavior problems rooted in emotions that professional trainers and pet parents often find difficult to understand and treat. Largely written for the advanced-level behavior consultant, Chapter 17 focuses on aggression of all kinds providing trainers with the tools they need to address the most challenging cases. This chapter provides easy-to-understand and use protocols for problem-solving on aggression topics including red flags, an assessment intake form for private behavioral consultations, a liability contract, and a veterinary behavioral report. Chapter 17 also explores desensitization and counterconditioning exercises and techniques for frustration reactivity, human and dog-dog aggression, sibling rivalry in multi-dog households, resource guarding and a <i>Do Not</i> list for family, friends, and visitors. Chapter 18 provides assessment, management and adjunct treatment of allergies to the veterinary plan. The nuanced triggers for barking and how to decrease barking and stress are explored in Chapter 19. Chapter 20, helps the pet parent and the consultant develop a dogs and babies plan that begins, ideally, far before the new baby comes home. In Chapter 21, the causes and treatment of fear are explored. In closing, Part 4, Chapter 22, provides a comprehensive assessment and treatment plan for separation anxiety disorder and related behaviors.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">I hope this book may help dogs and the people who love dogs, whether they work with dogs professionally, or touch dogs\xe2\x80\x99 lives in any way. Let\xe2\x80\x99s help them to thrive.</p>\n<div id="hoopla-highlight-container"></div></body>\n</html>'</p>
