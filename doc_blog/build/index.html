Marking the emergence of the force-free age in the field of dog training, The<i> </i>Hierarchy of Dog Needs<span style=" font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: super;">\xc2\xae</span><i> </i>is a logical and progressive paradigm whose time has come. The Hierarchy of Dog Needs (HDN)<i> </i>is a wholistic system of care that takes a clear and ethical stand on dog welfare needs and dog-training methods and devices. The HDN is a novel adaptation of renowned psychologist Abraham Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Hierarchy of</i> (human) <i>Needs</i> that emphasizes strengths, positivity, free will/choice, and a belief in the wholeness of animal nature (Maslow, 1943). Research shows that when biological needs, safety needs, and belongingness needs are met for social animals, they are far less likely to display abnormal behavior. The Hierarchy of Dog Needs is supported by scientific evidence as demonstrated in this handbook and makes no apologies for embracing protective ethics concerning our beloved dogs.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs infographic and this handbook provide teaching tools for all types of industry professionals and pet parents to use as a force-free alternative to the more conventional but dated teaching paradigms currently available. Anyone who interacts with or studies dogs, or any animal for that matter, can use it successfully. The HDN lists dog needs hierarchically but the levels are fluid rather than static. Once basic needs have been assessed and met, the training methods may be used in <i>any order</i> of choice, dependent upon the situation, context, and expertise of the handler.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs is a guide to animal wellness and <i>Do No Harm Dog Training. </i>The Hierarchy of Dog Needs<i> </i>was created as a guide to standards of basic care in dog welfare needs and best force-free training practices. The HDN is in use internationally by veterinarians, veterinary behaviorists, dog trainers (including working-dog and police-dog trainers), groomers, shelters, rescues, animal welfare advocates, and pet parents. The HDN has been translated into French, Spanish, Portuguese, Danish, Chinese, German, Estonian, Korean, Greek and Arabic to date, with many more requests awaiting translation.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs is a tool for animal wellness and serves as an essential companion to the <i>Do No Harm Dog Training Handbook. </i>HDN <i>Force-free Training</i> <i>Needs </i>methods and this handbook may be used for both common behavioral problems and the most challenging issues, such as housetraining, loose leash-walking, excessive barking, separation anxiety, fear, dog-dog aggression, human aggression, resource guarding, and more. It can help to identify the primary, secondary, and other problems affecting the dog and help guide the path of training.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">There is an increasingly strong dog-human bond in society and it makes sense that a more dog-friendly, dog-needs paradigm was needed and thus developed. Too often basic needs are not met or are under met. Dog needs are not considered in punitive or \xe2\x80\x9cbalanced\xe2\x80\x9d training approaches where the focus is on punishing unwanted pet dog behavior and not on dog welfare. <i>Do No Harm</i> training makes dogs\xe2\x80\x99 lives better because it is more effective, safer, and has longer lasting effects. <i>Do No Harm</i> is truly dog friendly.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs infographic is not intended to be a treatise on learning theory<i>.</i> Science has examined many different types of learning that include: Habituation, sensitization, desensitization, positive reinforcement, positive punishment, negative reinforcement, negative punishment, extinction, imitation, mimicry, and social learning. In other teaching paradigms, understanding behavior uses Skinnerian-related quadrants as a means to categorize response frequency. Placing every behavior response into a quadrant is not always helpful or the best approach to understanding emotional and behavioral modification and training needs. Only those methods that are physically and emotionally safe for dogs are included on the HDN and taught in the handbook.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The HDN pyramid infographic was designed to be a stand-alone guide covering as much critical territory for dog welfare and training in a one-page format as feasible. The HDN addresses as many primary needs and force-free training methods as possible, however, no infographic can convey all things to all pet professionals. Scientific advisor Dr. Luis Suoto Soubrier aptly points out, \xe2\x80\x9cThe main message and the paramount goal of The Hierarchy of Dog Needs are clear. By introducing further nuances and provisos, even after writing an exhaustive (and exhausting to read) set of rules, we would still, unavoidably, be simplifying reality anyway\xe2\x80\x9d (L. Suoto Soubrier, personal communication, 2015).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The joys, challenges, and responsibilities of pet parenting involve loving care and fit well with The Hierarchy of Dog Needs model. Of primary importance is the enhanced relationship the pet parent nurtures with their dog by using the HDN. Nurturing and developing social skills and confidence in your dog sets the stage for optimal well-being, using force-free training, instead of instilling fear and potentiating aggression.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal"><i>Do No Harm</i> is fast becoming the gold standard of care throughout the dog-training field. Pet parents and professionals are now applying emotional and behavioral modification methods using the <i>Do No Harm </i>model. The time has come to chart a new course making responsible dog training method the best practice.</p>\n<p id="i__the_do_no_harm_ethical_codes" class="P_Subheader_-16">I. The Do No Harm Ethical Codes</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Ethics are at the very heart of <i>Do No Harm Dog Training and Behavior Handbook</i> and the HDN. The embedded <i>Do No Harm</i> ethical code follows force-free, aversive-free, punitive-free training methods alone as best practices. To stem the tide of animal abuse in the dog training industry, canine behavior consultants are raising their voices in regulating practices in the field of dog training.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Pet Professional Guild (PPG) (2020c) is the first international, independent certifying dog training organization to take a clear, uncompromising, antithetical position on the use of shock, prong, choke, dominance, pain and fear-based methods in dog training. Members are fully vetted and must conform to a non-negotiable ethical code of conduct and standards. Members forfeit their membership status for violations of the ethical standards. We need more of these organizations to help protect and defend our dogs\xe2\x80\x99 well-being.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Professional organizations caring for and treating sentient beings all have ethical codes guiding their members and detailing acceptable standards of care.

Aversive training has been associated with detrimental effects on the human\xe2\x80\x93animal bond, problem-solving ability, and the physical and behavioral health of the patient. It causes problem behaviors in normal animals and hastens progression of behavioral disorders in distressed animals. Aversive techniques are especially injurious to fearful and aggressive patients and often suppress signals of impending aggression, rendering any aggressive dog more dangerous. Aversive techniques include prong (pinch) or choke collars, cattle prods, alpha rolls, dominance downs, electronic shock collars, lunge whips, starving or withholding food, entrapment, and beating.

No single model of behavior can comprehensively understand, explain and predict behavior. The Hierarchy of Dog Needs<i> </i>however<i> </i>is multi-modal, multi-dimensional, and based upon a number of behavioral models providing a more complete and eclectic representation of learning and behavior than any one of the classic models of behavior do alone. Below are some popular <i>schools of thought</i> and theories about the nature of behavior.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">The Behavioral Model</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The Behavioral Model attributes behavior to the environment. The environment drives behavior through antecedents and postcedent consequences. Behavioral Analysis is based upon the <i>if, then contingency</i>. Behavior is learned, that is conditioned through</p>\n<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">\n<li class="P_ListItem"><p class="P_ListParagraph"><i>Classical Conditioning:</i> Associations learned by pairing one stimulus\xe2\x80\x94the antecedent, to another stimulus</p>\n</li>\n<li class="P_ListItem"><p class="P_ListParagraph_1"><i>Operant Conditioning: </i>Reinforcement or punishment also known as consequences or postcedents</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p class="P_Normal">More often than not both classical conditioning and operant conditioning occur simultaneously and are inextricably linked with each other. However, these two types of learning are typically spoken of independently so students and trainers may more easily understand the concepts of behaviorism. With this clarity, practitioners can identify the underlying principles leading to the formulation of a plan for treating a specific problem, behavior, or emotion. The researchers most notably responsible for developing these representational systems of behavior are research scientists Ivan Pavlov and B. F. Skinner.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">This model theorizes that a dog bites a person because the dog has been reinforced or punished for biting, or the dog associates the person with something that previously caused an involuntary physiological response and/or a learned aversive response.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">The Affective Neuroscience Model</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The Affective Neuroscience Model of behavior attributes behavior to functions of the brain modulated by hormones. The emotional systems model theorizes that environment, behavior, and emotion cannot be isolated from each other, resulting in the activation of multiple emotional and behavioral systems in any given schema. Some of the most notable researchers in this area include Charles Darwin, Jaak Panksepp, and Joseph E. Ledoux.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">This model theorizes that a dog bites a person because the dog is experiencing fear, panic, or rage on the neurological and hormonal levels.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">The Ethological Model</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The Ethological Model of behavior attributes behavior to evolutionary adaptive traits with a focus on field studies in natural environments. The identification of <i>Modal Action Patterns (MAP)</i>, inherited tendencies to make specific and complex responses to specific environmental stimuli, helping scientists to understand behavior. Some of the most notable researchers in this area include Charles Darwin, Konrad Lorenz, Niko Tinbergen, and Simon Gadbois.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">This model theorizes that a dog bites a person because it is adaptive to survival to bite when threatened or to compete for resources.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">The Medical Model</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The Medical Model of behavior attributes behavior to wellness or the lack thereof.

Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s Hierarchy of Needs\xe2\x80\x94The Third Force in Behavior</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Students of psychology are familiar with <i>The Hierarchy of </i>[human]<i> Needs.</i> The Hierarchy of Dog Needs is a novel variation of renowned psychologist, Abraham Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s Hierarchy of Needs, adapting a human model of behavior to fit dogs. Similar needs occur in all species.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Animal models of human needs are traditionally used in research where the results and conclusions are extrapolated to humans to help us understand disease and develop treatments in medicine and behavior. Pavlov developed his theories of classical conditioning using dogs as his subjects in research. Skinner developed his theories of operant conditioning using pigeons as his research subjects. The field of comparative psychology explores cross-species comparisons, including those between humans and animals (Tinbergen, 1963).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Maslow, disenchanted with the popularized behaviorist paradigm of his time, cofounded the school of thought in psychology called <i>humanism</i>, the <i>Third Force</i> that emerged subsequent to psychoanalysis and behaviorism (Leahey, 2001). During the summer of 1938, Maslow conducted anthropologic research on a Blackfoot Native American reservation that is believed to have inspired him to theorize a new understanding of the fundamental features of human nature (Taylor, 2019)<i>.</i></p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Humanistic psychology emphasizes strengths, positivism, choice, and a belief in the wholeness of animal nature. In Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s own words: \xe2\x80\x9cSelf-actualized people have the wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder and even ecstasy, however stale these experiences may have become to others\xe2\x80\x9d (Maslow, 1943, pp. 370\xe2\x80\x93396). Does this not definitively describe what we often observe in our dogs? We witness our dogs taking great joy in simple things, over and over again. Taking a (w)holistic view of the sentient dog, The Hierarchy of Dog Needs combines both wholeness and behaviorist templates for wellness and emotional and behavioral modification understanding that both mental events and previously reinforced learned behaviors are causal. Humanism asserts that the present and the future and the past influence us.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Following on the heels of Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s work and others, the former President of the American Psychological Association, and renowned research scientists, Martin Seligman, became the face of <i>Positive Psychology</i> (Seligman, 2020). He called for an alternative to psychology\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crelentless focus on the negative\xe2\x80\x9d and for research into growth, mastery and drive. Today, much research and many academic textbooks explore topics including well-being, the science of happiness, and peak performance. Seligman\xe2\x80\x99s most famous work on <i>learned helplessness</i> (Seligman, 1972) demonstrated that dogs that had previously learned that escape from shock was impossible, would not even attempt to escape once escape was on option. His breakthrough research shows that <i>mental events are causal, even in our dogs</i> (Seligman cited in Schultz &amp; Schultz, 2008).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Maslow further developed his theory in <i>Motivation and Personality</i>, highlighting the significance of relationships<i> </i>(Maslow, 1954). <i>The Hierarchy of </i>[human]<i> Needs</i> remains a very popular framework in secondary and higher education psychology instruction and research. The nature of our relationships with our dogs deserves more attention, thus introducing this adaptation to dog care and training is a unique pleasure.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Dogs have the opportunity to reach an optimal state of well-being when all their needs are met. This is the singular objective of The Hierarchy of Dog Needs principles and procedures, standards of care and best practices. All needs highlighted in the Hierarchy of Dog Needs are interconnected. Needs are similarly dynamic in humans. Researchers find those whose needs for safety and belongingness are met are far less likely to display distraught and disordered behavior than those who have not had these needs satisfied (Schultz &amp; Schultz, 2008).</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent_SB"><b>Note:</b> While a pyramid has become a popular way to represent <i>The Hierarchy of </i>[human]<i> Needs</i>, Maslow himself never used a pyramid to illustrate his levels in any of his writings on the subject.</p>\n<div id="hoopla-highlight-container"></div></body>\n</html>'</p>

The voices taking a clear stand against pain-based collar devices and aversive control methods masquerading as dog training grow louder.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs defines <i>Standards of Care and Best Practices</i> in force-free training. Attending to animal welfare needs <i>and</i> exclusively force-free methods are setting the gold standard in emotional and behavioral modification and training. The ethical code embedded within <i>The</i> <i>Do No Harm Dog Training</i><span style=" font-style: italic; font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: super;">\xc2\xae</span><i> and Behavior Handbook </i>and the <i>Hierarchy of Dog Needs</i><span style=" font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: super;">\xc2\xae</span> (HDN) is grounded in animal welfare principles and dog-friendly dog training. By virtue of providing ethical standards and practices guidelines in the dog training field and industry, we hope to help lead the way, making life easier and more joyful for our dogs and the people who love them.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">In developing a new force-free model of best practices, we no longer leave the door open for aversive/punitive measures in dog training. The extant training models focus largely on quadrants in learning theory yet sadly, have too often been misused as a rationale and justification for the application of punitive methods in training. The ubiquitous misapplication of methods in an unregulated industry is the problem.<b> </b>Doing psychological or physical harm to a captive dog points to a lack of skill and competence on the part of the trainer. There is no justification for harsh treatment or training with dogs, or any animal for that matter, unless one\xe2\x80\x99s life or safety is in immediate danger. The methods detailed in the HDN may be used in any order without risk to the dog: <i>Do No Harm</i> methods never asks or directs the pet parent to hurt their dog psychologically or physically.<b> </b>We seek to \xe2\x80\x9cdo no harm\xe2\x80\x9d physically or psychologically to dogs under our care and training at all times.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Shock collar training is a serious animal welfare concern in the United States and across the globe. Frequently, animal abuse masquerades as dog training. How can the average pet parent be expected to make a well-informed decision with regard to behavior modification tools when so many dog trainers, misinformed professionals, and manufacturers of shock products misrepresent the true nature of their effects? There is simply no place for shock, prong, choke, or other aversive devices in companion animal training.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">In \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Shock is Not Behavior Modification,\xe2\x80\x9d principal investigator Dr. Karen Overall (2013), editor of the Journal of Veterinary Behavior states, \xe2\x80\x9cThe use of shock is not treatment for pets with behavioral concerns\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 111). The popular myth that shock \xe2\x80\x9csaves lives\xe2\x80\x9d has no evidence to support it. Indeed, nothing could be further from the truth. A hypothetical fallacy with the alternative of either shocking a dog or euthanizing a dog is a patently false dichotomy commonly posed by shock proponents. Dr. Overall states unequivocally, \xe2\x80\x9cThe use of shock does not bring dogs back from the brink of euthanasia; instead, it may send them there\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 111). Using punitive methods or devices in training can cause an increase in anxiety that often leads to further behavioral problems, resulting in pet parents relinquishing their animals to overflowing shelters. If progressive zoos are successful in changing the behavior of the animals in their care using force-free training methods alone, behavioral consultants, trainers and other professionals, ought to do the same for our pet dogs.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">In addition, dog bites are an increasingly grave public safety issue, making dog-training methods a public health concern. Bite incidents resulting from the administration of shock are not uncommon\xe2\x80\x94it is well documented in scientific literature that inflicting pain is a cause of aggressive behavior.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs has received a very positive and warm response from the dog loving community. It is in use by veterinary behaviorists, integrative and holistic veterinarians, gentle groomers, dog walkers, pet sitters and service dog organizations, trainers, and pet parents. It is designed for dog trainers teaching classes and those conducting private consultations. The infographic is particularly helpful to shelters, rescues, foster pet parents, and animal welfare advocates. It is in use as a teaching guide in colleges, on websites, on television, and by a growing, international base of pet parents interested in the <i>Do No Harm</i> ideology and practice of dog training.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Dr. Katrina Ward, DVM, remarking on her presentation of the HDN to the Australian Veterinary Association conference said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hierarchy of Dog Needs was very well received and hopefully will be taken up as a routine method of assessing needs and applying humane behavior modification\xe2\x80\x9d (as cited in Michaels, 2015/2020). Dr. Lynn Honeckman, DVM and behavior specialist in Orlando, Florida, uses the HDN to teach pre-vet students in her veterinary clinic presentations. Everyone from national crisis response human and dog trainers to working dog trainers are using it. In a television morning show featuring the Hierarchy of Dog Needs Maarja Tali, guest lecturer at Tallin University in Estonia says,</p>\n<p class="P_Block_Quote__And__Spacing_After"><i>After the basic needs are met, dogs need to feel safe and loved. Relationships are as important to dogs [as they are to humans]. So, before we start drilling or shaping or teaching or training, it is much more important that we have a good trust-based relationship with our dog. One of the most important messages here is that before we even get to training, we need to understand whether the dog is ready to learn.</i> (Tali, 2019)</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_14">How This Handbook is Organized</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent"><b>Part 1.</b> <b>The Hierarchy of Dog Needs Standards of Care and Best Force-free Practices</b> provides the theoretical foundations that support the Hierarchy of Dog Needs for each level of the pyramid and elaborates on each method of <i>Force-free Training.</i> Part 1 includes fully referenced, scientific citations for professionals and readers assuring scientific rigor. The citations enable force-free practitioners and supporters to empirically defend their stance on animal welfare needs, providing the evidence to do so at their fingertips. Part 1 is also designed for speakers, researchers, and instructors as the platform for teaching cutting edge, informative presentations based upon dog-centered needs and the <i>Hierarchy of Dog Needs/</i><i>Do No Harm</i> paradigm. The For the Pet Professional section offers various ways that pet professionals can use The Hierarchy of Dog Needs and the <i>Do No Harm </i>handbook to teach others. Pet professionals will find information on creating presentations, how to use the handbook in private consultations, how to create coursework for class curricula and ideas for using the HDN and the handbook in social media with examples that both carry the <i>Do No Harm/</i>force-free message and enhance and support business goals.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Chapter 1 discusses <i>Biological Needs</i>, including proper nutrition, the need for fresh water, sufficient and appropriate exercise, sufficient air with a focus on brachycephalic breeds, sufficient sleep, avoiding outdoor hazards with indoor shelter, and proper temperature control avoiding hyperthermia and hypothermia. Chapter 1 also illustrates the critical need for gentle grooming and gentle veterinary care. Chapter 2 address the <i>Emotional Needs</i> for security which fosters secure attachment, love, trust, consistency, and benevolent leadership. Chapter 3, <i>Social Needs</i>, explores<i> </i>bonding with people and dogs, and the purpose of play. <i>Cognitive Needs</i> detailing the relevance of choice, novelty and problem-solving activities are examined in Chapter 4.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Chapter 5,<i> Force-free Training Needs </i>defines force-free dog training and thoroughly describes the best practices listed in the Hierarchy of Dog Needs guide: Management, antecedent modification, positive reinforcement, the types of differential reinforcement, classical and counterconditioning, desensitization, the Premack Principle, and social learning are all defined and illustrated with straightforward, clear, dog-centered examples of each method.</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent_SB"><b>Part 2.</b> <b>Setting Your Dog Up for Success</b> is useful for pet professionals and pet-parents, as it lays the groundwork for success in raising a dog: Chapter 6 explores why success begins with choosing a puppy or dog that is likely to fit your lifestyle. In chapters 7\xe2\x80\x938, specific criteria are outlined to help pet parents find a competent and kind dog trainer, and to select a dog-friendly veterinarian and groomer, some of the most determinative decisions one will make in a dog\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime. Chapter 9 explains how to socialize a puppy or dog safely and carefully and how to avoid the common pitfalls of flooding puppies and rescue dogs with stimuli that can cause well-intended plans to backfire. Chapter 10 explores how and why to provide enrichment. Part 2 concludes with a discussion in Chapter 11 on the importance of learning dog body language to better understand how your dog is trying to communicate with you and others.</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent_SB"><b>Part 3.</b> <b>Good Manners and Basic Training</b> focuses on manners and training mechanics in an easy-to-learn and follow step-by-step roadmap of the nuts and bolts of teaching the basic skills everyone wants their dogs to learn. Chapter 12 explains the top ten tips for successful housetraining. Chapter 13 teaches how to replace puppy and adult dog biting, mouthing and chewing with alternate behaviors. In Chapters 14 and 15, training techniques and trainer \xe2\x80\x9csecrets\xe2\x80\x9d provide instructions for teaching dogs with the methods that successful force-free trainers use. All of the basic training needs including calm greetings, no jump, sit, down, wait, lightning recall (come) and leash-walking skills are found in Chapter 16. Part 3 includes numerous examples making sometimes complex learning principles and techniques easy for anyone to teach and understand.</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent_SB"><b>Part 4.</b> <b>When Things Go Wrong</b> addresses behavior problems rooted in emotions that professional trainers and pet parents often find difficult to understand and treat. Largely written for the advanced-level behavior consultant, Chapter 17 focuses on aggression of all kinds providing trainers with the tools they need to address the most challenging cases. This chapter provides easy-to-understand and use protocols for problem-solving on aggression topics including red flags, an assessment intake form for private behavioral consultations, a liability contract, and a veterinary behavioral report. Chapter 17 also explores desensitization and counterconditioning exercises and techniques for frustration reactivity, human and dog-dog aggression, sibling rivalry in multi-dog households, resource guarding and a <i>Do Not</i> list for family, friends, and visitors. Chapter 18 provides assessment, management and adjunct treatment of allergies to the veterinary plan. The nuanced triggers for barking and how to decrease barking and stress are explored in Chapter 19. Chapter 20, helps the pet parent and the consultant develop a dogs and babies plan that begins, ideally, far before the new baby comes home. In Chapter 21, the causes and treatment of fear are explored. In closing, Part 4, Chapter 22, provides a comprehensive assessment and treatment plan for separation anxiety disorder and related behaviors.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">I hope this book may help dogs and the people who love dogs, whether they work with dogs professionally, or touch dogs\xe2\x80\x99 lives in any way. Let\xe2\x80\x99s help them to thrive.</p>\n<div id="hoopla-highlight-container"></div></body>\n</html>'</p>
