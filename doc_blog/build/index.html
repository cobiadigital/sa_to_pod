The day before, Heflin, who represented Alabama in the US House, had introduced a bill to extend Jim Crow segregation to the District of Columbia\xe2\x80\x99s streetcars. Just before the shooting, Heflin was on a streetcar in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital on his way to give a lecture at a Methodist church on \xe2\x80\x9cTemperance\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which in that context meant prohibition\xe2\x80\x94when two Black men boarded the car. One of those men, Louis (or Lewis) Lundy, produced a flask, at which point Heflin berated him for drinking in front of a white lady. Lundy \xe2\x80\x9creplied that he\xe2\x80\x99d take a drink if he felt like it.\xe2\x80\x9d Everyone left the car at the next stop except Heflin, the unnamed white woman, Lundy, and an unnamed Black man. When Lundy rose to take a drink, Heflin engaged him, and Lundy grabbed him by the lapel. Heflin drew a pistol, hit Lundy on the head with the butt, shoved and kicked Lundy off the car, and fired two shots at him. One of the shots hit Lundy in the neck, and another ricocheted into a white bystander, Thomas McCreary.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en1" href="part0020.html#ch03en1e">1</a></span> While Heflin was briefly arrested, he was soon bailed out and charges against him were soon dropped.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">In one sense, this behavior fit with Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s lifelong advocacy of white supremacism. As a delegate to the convention for the 1901 Alabama Constitution, Heflin successfully pushed for measures to disfranchise Black voters, stating: \xe2\x80\x9cGod Almighty intended the negro to be the servant of the white man.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en2" href="part0020.html#ch03en2e">2</a></span> While serving as secretary of state for Alabama in 1903, he publicly supported white men who had Black men fraudulently arrested and then forced them to perform slave labor through convict leasing, arguing that such efforts helped maintain white supremacy. As he represented his state in the US House from 1904 to 1920, he routinely spouted racist vitriol.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en3" href="part0020.html#ch03en3e">3</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">More broadly, Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s vigilante action weaves together southern prohibition and Jim Crow in several ways. First, the incident highlights how prominent white southern drys used their power to promote white supremacism and Jim Crow laws, such as the streetcar law Heflin had introduced the day before the shooting. While Heflin, like many other \xe2\x80\x9cstates\xe2\x80\x99 rights\xe2\x80\x9d southerners, later opposed <span class="italic">federal</span> prohibition, speaking on \xe2\x80\x9cTemperance\xe2\x80\x9d at a Methodist church implied his dry stance at the local and state levels. Other prominent white drys across the South likewise linked prohibition to white supremacism. Tennessee\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition \xe2\x80\x9cmartyr\xe2\x80\x9d Edward Ward Carmack, Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cFather of American Prohibition\xe2\x80\x9d Richmond Pearson Hobson, and Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s Southern Methodist Bishop James Cannon also numbered among white drys who advocated both prohibition and strict racial hierarchy.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Second, the shooting suggested how fears connecting racial disorder and gender, which inspired Jim Crow laws, also helped the cause of prohibition. Heflin attributed the incident to a Black man drinking alcohol in the same streetcar as a white woman, an allusion to fears of drunk Black men assaulting white women and to Black criminality generally. White drys had openly argued that legal segregation and banning alcohol would keep Black men docile and so protect the virtue of white women, thus preventing the need for lynchings. The notion of protecting white women\xe2\x80\x99s honor from inebriated Black men was a key component of prohibition advocacy in the South.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The shooting also reflected how white churches supported the values of Jim Crow and prohibition. While Heflin did not explicitly connect his white-supremacist violence to his faith, he was a white Christian on his way to a Methodist church to lecture on temperance when it happened. Instead of leading him to turn the other cheek or at least stay his hand, Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s convictions whipped him into a nearly lethal rage at the sight of a Black man who violated his racial, gender, and alcohol taboos. While it might be tempting for believers to claim Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s behavior was out of step with \xe2\x80\x9ctrue\xe2\x80\x9d Christian faith, religious and racial convictions are strands of a contingent and experiential fabric and are demonstrated by their fruits. Far more important than what Heflin himself did is how white Christians around the South responded. The lack of a serious rebuke from his peers indicated their tacit consent\xe2\x80\x94if not nodding approval\xe2\x80\x94for his near-murder of a Black man who had the temerity to sip alcohol in front of a white woman on a streetcar. White churches in the South and around the nation thus showed more support for a white champion of Jim Crow and prohibition than the Black man he nearly shot to death.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Support for Heflin was not limited to churches. Regardless of party or home region, Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s white colleagues in the US House heaped praise and sympathy on him. Southern white members excused his \xe2\x80\x9cimpetuous temperament\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chis views on the race question.\xe2\x80\x9d Within minutes of Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s arrest, offers to pay his $5,000 bond came from House members representing parts of Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North and South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and most of the Alabama districts.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en4" href="part0020.html#ch03en4e">4</a></span> Other Democrats offering to pay Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s bail came from beyond the former Confederacy, including Charles Ferris Booher of Missouri and John Geiser McHenry of Pennsylvania. Sympathy for Heflin and regret for the incident came \xe2\x80\x9cfrom all quarters,\xe2\x80\x9d including the Republican Speaker of the House, Joseph Gurney Cannon of Illinois.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en5" href="part0020.html#ch03en5e">5</a></span> Even the white man Heflin accidentally shot shared his white supremacism. When an ambulance took Lundy, the also-wounded McCreary ordered a separate carriage, since he refused to ride with a Black man to the hospital.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en6" href="part0020.html#ch03en6e">6</a></span> McCreary also dropped charges when Heflin offered to pay his hospital bills.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en7" href="part0020.html#ch03en7e">7</a></span> Whites regardless of party or region saw little need to punish Heflin for nearly killing a Black man who defied the racial order.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The ties between prohibition and Jim Crow were not limited to extraordinary incidents like this but extended to changing laws around the South. On New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, 1908, the first statewide prohibition law in the South went into effect. Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s state legislature voted overwhelmingly for the measure in July 1907. The Georgia House voted 139 to 39 in favor on July 30; then the Senate approved the amended bill 34 to 7, and the governor promptly signed it.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en8" href="part0020.html#ch03en8e">8</a></span> It seemed fitting that the state whose capital, Atlanta, was the first major city in the South to opt for prohibition in 1885 would also be the first southern state to go dry.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">As far as Black voters were concerned, however, the 1885 and 1907 measures could not have been more different. While white drys and white wets competed for African American votes in the 1880s, Jim Crow laws in the 1890s and 1900s had marginalized Black voters in nearly all major political contests. Prohibitionist whites were particularly insistent on suppressing Black votes, which they blamed for their failures in decades past. As statewide prohibition laws spread throughout the South in the 1900s and 1910s, the dry movement became increasingly white and ever more entwined with Jim Crow. This sharp turn to Jim Crow\xe2\x80\x94and prohibitionist \xe2\x80\x9cGin Crow\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in the South can best be properly understood by way of a brief detour into the greatest interracial political movement across the region between the 1870s and the 1960s: populism. While not directly bearing on prohibition, populism reveals how interracial politics rose, nearly triumphed, and crashed dramatically, providing the immediate context for the white-supremacist alliance between drys and advocates of Jim Crow.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Political Prelude: Populists</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">After the failure of interracial cooperation in the prohibition contests of the 1880s, the next major effort at multiracial political coalitions in the South was the Populist Party or People\xe2\x80\x99s Party. According to Gerald H. Gaither, historians have generally fallen into three schools of thought on how Black men interacted with the populist movement. The progressive school of the 1920s and 1930s treated Black voters as tools of whites, more inclined to sell their votes than engage in the political process to achieve their own interests. The consensus school of the 1950s, however, emphasized the class solidarity of Black and white farmers and optimistically posited that interracial politics could have succeeded if events had only gone differently. A more pessimistic recent school since the 1990s has emphasized institutional racism over class and concluded that interracial politics between relatively marginalized Blacks and relatively more secure whites was doomed to failure. While surveying these three perspectives, Gaither argues that southern populism is \xe2\x80\x9ca many-faceted crystal that does not fit easily into any set historiographical formula.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en9" href="part0020.html#ch03en9e">9</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The Populist Party grew out of the Farmers\xe2\x80\x99 Alliance, a farmers\xe2\x80\x99 cooperative whose white leaders initially sought to win over Bourbon Democrats to support their cause. Founded in 1874 or 1875 in Lampasas County, Texas, the alliance sought to help small-time farmers through the hard times brought on by declining cotton prices. Charles William Macune grew the organization but sought to keep it \xe2\x80\x9ca strictly white man\xe2\x80\x99s nonpolitical secret business association.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en10" href="part0020.html#ch03en10e">10</a></span> Macune, a Democrat, denied Blacks membership in the Texas Alliance and sought to pressure Democratic politicians to advance farmers\xe2\x80\x99 interests, not turn it into a political party.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The alliance spread west, and by 1887 the Texas Alliance had fused with the Louisiana Farmers\xe2\x80\x99 Union, forging the National Farmers\xe2\x80\x99 Alliance and Co-operative Union of America, commonly called the Southern Alliance. By 1888, the enlarged Southern Alliance merged with another farmers\xe2\x80\x99 cooperative, the Agricultural Wheel. Two years earlier, in 1886, the Colored Farmers\xe2\x80\x99 Alliance (CFA) had been founded in Texas as a secret society working for the interests of Black farmers following the philosophy of self-help and racial uplift. By 1888, the white farmers of the Southern Alliance formally endorsed collaboration with the CFA, which aspired to represent the region\xe2\x80\x99s 4.5 million African American farmers. The CFA, for its part, depended on economic aid from whites to support most of its state exchanges to help farmers struggling with low crop prices. Even before the Populist Party was founded, there was limited interracial cooperation in the alliance organizations that preceded it.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en11" href="part0020.html#ch03en11e">11</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Despite the rhetoric of shared self-interest for Black and white farmers, however, most African Americans had difficulty making common cause with white farmers for racial and economic reasons. The racial order of the South prevented integration of the alliance organizations. Most southern white farmers refused to treat African Americans as their social equals, and most Black farmers preferred Black-only organizations to work for their common racial interest and to avoid sabotage by white interlopers. Despite the nonpartisan nature of the alliances, they did address lightning-rod political issues along racial lines. In 1890, white Southern Alliance members denounced a \xe2\x80\x9cForce Bill\xe2\x80\x9d that would have allowed federal supervision of southern elections, while the CFA endorsed it. While whites and Blacks both supported the Subtreasury Plan of federal aid to farmers with loans, crop storage, and price controls, the CFA also backed more radical measures such as a socialistic single tax to move land ownership to communal control, while the Southern Alliance preferred a more modest graduated income tax.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Economically, the vision of shared interests by all farmers in the South was little more than fanciful fiction. Many white farmers in the Southern Alliance were small landowners who were primarily interested in raising crop prices while most Black farmers were tenant farmers chiefly concerned about raising wages. By 1888, the Southern Alliance proposed to support the Colored Alliance to mobilize some while still upholding the doctrine of racial segregation. While several state branches of the CFA supported strikes by Black workers in 1891, the white Southern Alliances denounced the strikes. When push came to shove, differences of race and class divided southern farmers deeply.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en12" href="part0020.html#ch03en12e">12</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Nonetheless, the Populist Party, or People\xe2\x80\x99s Party, emerged from the alliance movement in the South due to Bourbon Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to implement alliance policies. Despite the efforts of Macune and others to keep the alliance nonpartisan, some supported a \xe2\x80\x9cPeople\xe2\x80\x99s ticket\xe2\x80\x9d that swept out Bourbon Democrats in Comanche County, Texas, in the summer of 1886. Local People\xe2\x80\x99s Party elections won in a few races until 1890, when several alliance organizations in the West and South endorsed the newly organized Populist Party. Texans such as James \xe2\x80\x9cCyclone\xe2\x80\x9d Davis (white) and John Rayner (Black) eventually backed the new party as well. While Davis argued that the Populist Party platform came from the Democratic principles of Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson, Rayner appealed to African Americans disillusioned with the Republican Party.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en13" href="part0020.html#ch03en13e">13</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Some African Americans in the South considered joining the Populist Party due to long-standing tensions with the Republican Party. While white Radical Republicans supported Black citizenship rights in the 1860s and 1870s, most white Republican elites soured on protecting African Americans. The Liberal Republican split-off in 1872 denounced federal interventions in the South that protected African American citizens from white terrorism, and the contested 1876 election resulted in a Republican president, Rutherford B. Hayes, who declined to send in federal troops when white supremacists violently seized power in Louisiana, Florida, and South Carolina. After white-supremacist Democrats took firm control of southern state governments in the late 1870s, some white Republicans reasoned that they needed to embrace white supremacy to have a chance at power in the region. These \xe2\x80\x9clily-white\xe2\x80\x9d Republicans clashed with \xe2\x80\x9cBlack and tan\xe2\x80\x9d Republicans, who embraced interracial politics. By the 1890s, most white Republicans, even in much of the South, had taken an ambivalent or hostile position toward Black political rights.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en14" href="part0020.html#ch03en14e">14</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">For their part, some African Americans in the South had taken steps to distance themselves from the Republican Party in the 1880s. Robert Reed Church Sr., the South\xe2\x80\x99s first Black millionaire and a saloon owner, ran unsuccessfully for Memphis\xe2\x80\x99s Board of Public Works in 1882 on the People\xe2\x80\x99s Ticket and Independent Ticket\xe2\x80\x94but not as a Republican.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en15" href="part0020.html#ch03en15e">15</a></span> John Rayner, a saloon operator and Republican politician in North Carolina in the 1860s and 1870s, dropped his GOP affiliation when he moved to Texas in the 1880s, preferring prohibition activism to partisan politics. Some African Americans even joined the Democratic Party. From 1878 to 1890, for example, twenty-one African Americans were elected as Democrats to the South Carolina House of Representatives. Nonetheless, most Black southerners still identified with the Republican Party in the 1890s.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en16" href="part0020.html#ch03en16e">16</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Despite its multiracial base, Populist leaders, both white and Black, insisted that they fought merely for political equality, not social equality. One white Populist in Alabama declared that the party was \xe2\x80\x9cfurther from . . . social equality, than any ballot box stuffer alive,\xe2\x80\x9d and their opposition to racial mixing did \xe2\x80\x9cnot relax at the going down of the sun.\xe2\x80\x9d Rayner, the son of a white father and a Black mother, went so far as to deflect white southerners\xe2\x80\x99 fear of miscegenation onto the Democrats. He often opened his Populist stump speeches before white audiences by remarking on his light skin and declaring that \xe2\x80\x9cthis is what he had received from the Democrats\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94even though his father was a Whig, not a Democrat.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en17" href="part0020.html#ch03en17e">17</a></span> While the Populist Party welcomed white and Black votes, it also upheld racial segregation.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Rayner\xe2\x80\x99s support of the Populists embodied the hope of many Black southerners that it could be their best chance for political and economic progress in the South since Reconstruction. He seized the chance to become the greatest African American \xe2\x80\x9corator, organizer, and political strategist\xe2\x80\x9d for the Populists from 1892 to 1898.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en18" href="part0020.html#ch03en18e">18</a></span> Rayner worked for negligible pay, planting African American Populist Party organizations and delivering powerful speeches for their cause throughout East Texas. As during the 1887 prohibition contest, he openly offered political advice to white comrades and attracted respect from white crowds. He also helped shift most African Americans\xe2\x80\x99 support from the Republicans to the Populists. Though just 20 percent of African Americans supported the Populists in 1892, 50 percent backed them four years later. For his efforts, Rayner was elected as the only African American delegate to the Texas Populists\xe2\x80\x99 state executive committee in 1896. As historian Charles Postel puts it, Rayner was \xe2\x80\x9cthe most prominent\xe2\x80\x9d African American in the movement nationally.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en19" href="part0020.html#ch03en19e">19</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">In the 1890s, Populists rose to prominence in state and federal elections throughout the South (<span>see <a class="nounder" href="part0015.html#tab03">table 3</a></span>). Georgian politician Tom Watson was elected to Congress in 1890 as an Alliance Democrat, loyal both to the party of white supremacy and to alliance issues, yet he faced furious opposition and defeat from Bourbon Democrats in 1892. In Texas, Populist gubernatorial candidate Thomas Nugent in 1894 received over 150,000 votes, or 36 percent of the total, displacing the Republicans as the most serious threat to Bourbon rule in the state. In 1894, Alabama Populists helped elect three men to the US House. Truman Heminway Aldrich, a Republican, ran for Congress with Populist backing against Democrat Oscar Underwood, while two outright Populists, Albert Taylor Goodwyn and Milford Wriarson Howard, also ran. Goodwyn and Aldrich lost due to fraud, though they both successfully challenged the results and took their seats for a few months from 1896 to March 1897. Howard, meanwhile, won clear majorities in 1894 and 1896, serving two terms.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en20" href="part0020.html#ch03en20e">20</a></span> Populists gained real political power throughout the South in the 1890s.</p>\n<p class="table-title" id="tab03"><b class="calibre2">Table 3.</b> Populists in the South, 1890s</p>\n<p class="images"><img src="../images/00017.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre3"/></p>\n<p class="x-txtf">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The Populists\xe2\x80\x99 greatest success in the South, however, was in North Carolina, but that story ended in tragedy for interracial politics. In 1894, Populists and Republicans combined forces to win most seats in both houses of the state legislature for a \xe2\x80\x9cFusion\xe2\x80\x9d government. No fewer than six Populists were elected to Congress between 1894 and 1898, and Marion Butler, a powerful figure in the state and national populist movement, became the only member of his party from the South elected to the US Senate, serving from 1895 to 1901. North Carolina Populists also helped deliver the governor\xe2\x80\x99s mansion to a Republican, Daniel Lindsay Russell, the only non-Democrat to serve as governor in that state between the 1870s and 1970s. African Americans took some seats in the upper and lower chambers of the state legislature, and George Henry White won a congressional seat in 1896 and 1898, becoming the only Black congressman at the time and the last African American in Congress from the South until the 1970s.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en21" href="part0020.html#ch03en21e">21</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Despite these initial successes, white supremacism overturned these gains by violence in 1898. Fomenting fears of \xe2\x80\x9cblack rule\xe2\x80\x9d and race riots, Democratic leaders such as newspaperman Josephus Daniels and Furnifold McLendel Simmons helped organize Red Shirt clubs to achieve Democratic victory through intimidation, murder, and fraud, sweeping the 1898 state legislative elections. When Wilmington, North Carolina, the state\xe2\x80\x99s largest city with a Black majority, elected a Republican mayor and city council in 1898 despite the reign of terror, white supremacists took violent action. They burned down the city\xe2\x80\x99s Black-run newspaper, murdered at least a dozen people, forced the Republican officeholders to resign at gunpoint, and prompted thousands of African Americans to leave the city\xe2\x80\x94enough to turn the city from majority-Black to majority-white, which it remains to the present day. As a reward for coordinating the white-supremacist coup, Simmons in 1901 took a seat in the US Senate, where he served for thirty years, and set up his powerful \xe2\x80\x9cSimmons machine\xe2\x80\x9d to reward his allies.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en22" href="part0020.html#ch03en22e">22</a></span> Despite this crushing defeat, North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s Fusionists in the 1890s, like Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s Readjusters before them, had threatened conservative Democratic rule in the post-Reconstruction South in ways that the Republican Party alone could not.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Outside of North Carolina, 1896 brought doom for the multiracial Populist coalition as an effective opposition to the Democratic Party in the South. The national People\xe2\x80\x99s Party supported William Jennings Bryan, the same presidential candidate as the Democrats that Rayner and other Black voters so hated. Many white Populists placed white supremacy above their economic interests and voted Democratic, while African Americans split their vote between the Populists and the Republicans. That year also signaled the return of white supremacy in Rayner\xe2\x80\x99s Robertson County by fraud, intimidation, and violence. As in the 1894 Texas elections, white Democrats committed massive fraud, buying votes outright from Mexican Americans and deceiving illiterate African Americans to vote for the Democratic ticket. By 1898, the Populist Party in Texas was effectively dead, and with it the dream of a multiracial coalition overthrowing white-only rule. After one last brief flirtation in 1902 with a Populist campaign that never materialized, Rayner and most other African Americans were finished with Populist politics.

The Populists launched the first serious attempt at interracial politics in the South since Reconstruction in the late 1890s, but Democrats used fraud, intimidation, and violence to defeat it. As the twentieth century dawned, so did new restrictive voting measures to suppress turnout from the supposedly unworthy citizens\xe2\x80\x94particularly (but not limited to) African Americans, who had provided essential support to the Populists. White Populists eventually rejoined the Democratic Party and infused it with a fiery commitment to exclude African Americans from politics entirely. As early as 1890, Edward R. Cocke, who led the Virginia Farmers\xe2\x80\x99 Alliance, petitioned to repeal the Fifteenth Amendment to stop Black voting. As Charles Postel put it, \xe2\x80\x9cThe white Farmers\xe2\x80\x99 Alliance was a driving force behind the new Jim Crow segregation laws adopted across the South.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en25" href="part0020.html#ch03en25e">25</a></span> While initially seeking Black votes, most white Populists eventually joined with white Democrats to advance white supremacy by disfranchising and segregating from their Black former allies through a series of laws collectively called \xe2\x80\x9cJim Crow.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p class="x-a">Jim Crow</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Repressive laws targeting African Americans in the former Confederacy began with the Black Codes. Pioneered by Mississippi\xe2\x80\x99s legislature in late 1865, in the aftermath of the Thirteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s abolition of racial chattel slavery, Black Codes were adopted in southern states by former Confederates eager to salvage some form of legal white supremacism. The codes included vagrancy laws to force unemployed Black men into harsh labor, apprenticeship laws to force underage Black children into quasi-slavery, and other laws calculated to reduce Black freedoms. Though these laws were overturned by Congressional Reconstruction in 1867, white southern Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 ambition to treat Black Americans as second-class citizens by law emerged with a vengeance with Jim Crow.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Soon after the end of Reconstruction, white Democrats experimented with various disfranchisement measures to achieve white-only rule.

A variety of literacy test, this law mandated eight distinct boxes for different offices in the election and required voters to put their ballots in the right box\xe2\x80\x94on which instructions had to be read\xe2\x80\x94or otherwise have their vote disqualified. While voting officials could aid voters with their choice, African American voters had little reason to trust white Democratic officers to direct them honestly. Even more nefarious was the law\xe2\x80\x99s lesser-known provision that all eligible voters had to <span class="italic">reregister</span> by June 1, 1882, or else be forever banned from voting. Given the broad powers of local officials in determining a voter\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility and an arduous appeals process, the disfranchisement aspect of the Eight Box Law was even more sinister than its eponym. Despite objections from Black legislators like state senator Thomas E. Miller of Beaufort and litigation by the US attorney for South Carolina, Samuel A. Melton, the state legislature followed Governor Hugh Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s advice to pay $10,000 to cover the legal fees of poll workers who were sued for abuse of Black voters\xe2\x80\x99 rights.

These laws divided into two major categories: racial segregation and voter suppression. While racial social divisions had existed even during Congressional Reconstruction and considerable Black voter suppression had been achieved by fraud and terrorism since 1877, neither social division nor disfranchisement was systematically enshrined by legal code in the late 1880s. Jim Crow was, in short, an attempt to secure and advance white supremacism by law.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en30" href="part0020.html#ch03en30e">30</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Popular accounts of Jim Crow often focus on segregation in schools, bathrooms, drinking fountains, and other public accommodations, yet the Jim Crow statutes most relevant to prohibition concerned disfranchisement. Some of these laws\xe2\x80\x94such as poll taxes, literacy tests, and grandfather clauses\xe2\x80\x94were not explicitly racial, but their intent and application excluded African Americans from meaningful political participation.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The most widespread and obvious attempt at voter suppression was the poll tax (<span>see <a class="nounder" href="part0015.html#tab04">table 4</a></span>). Ostensibly levied to provide funds for education, taxes on all voting-age men had existed long before the Civil War, but they were often laxly enforced. Arkansas, for example, authorized a poll tax in its first state constitution in 1836 as well as its Confederate constitution in 1861. Reconstruction-era states reined in poll taxes. For example, Arkansas\xe2\x80\x99s 1868 Reconstruction constitution stated: \xe2\x80\x9cThe levying of taxes by the poll is grievous and oppressive; therefore the general assembly shall never levy a poll tax excepting for school purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en31" href="part0020.html#ch03en31e">31</a></span> Poll taxes were a flat fee and therefore regressive, disproportionately burdening the poor, particularly African Americans. As Reconstruction\xe2\x80\x99s interracial politics fell to white Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 campaigns of terror and fraud, new state constitutions opted to include poll taxes. Under this new order, poll taxes were more strictly enforced and receipts were required to vote.</p>\n<p class="table-title" id="tab04"><b class="calibre2">Table 4.</b> Select Voter Suppression Laws by Year and State, 1875\xe2\x80\x931902</p>\n<p class="images"><img src="../images/00018.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre3"/></p>\n<p class="x-txtf">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The poll taxes in this era took two forms: opt-in and cumulative. Of the two, opt-in poll taxes allowed voting-age men to pay a flat rate to vote for the next year or six months, depending on the state. This option allowed voters to opt out of paying the poll tax for years\xe2\x80\x94at the cost of not being able to vote\xe2\x80\x94and then opt in for another voting period for a flat rate. Cumulative poll taxes, however, added up over time if left unpaid. Voters who skipped poll taxes for several years had to pay the cost of those years as well. In some states, the cost was capped at up to three years\xe2\x80\x99 worth of poll taxes, while others demanded payment for <span class="italic">every</span> year since a man turned twenty-one and thus became eligible to vote. Because cumulative taxes made a more onerous burden on the poor, both Black and white, they were more reliable at suppressing voter turnout than opt-in taxes.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">A pioneering state in poll taxes was Georgia, which adopted one as early as 1877. Georgia imposed a cumulative tax of $1.50 per person, requiring each person to pay a sum for every year since the law went into effect or since they turned twenty-one. Even earlier than Georgia was Virginia, which implemented its first round of poll taxes via constitutional amendment in 1876 at the behest of the Conservative Party (as Democrats were briefly called there), but a cross-racial coalition of Readjusters repealed the poll tax requirement in 1882.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en32" href="part0020.html#ch03en32e">32</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Populism\xe2\x80\x99s resurrection of interracial politics in the 1890s prompted white-supremacist Democrats across the South to take extreme measures, including poll taxes, to maintain their grip on power. Florida took the lead in 1889 with a $2.00 annual opt-in poll tax, followed later that year by Tennessee. While Tennessee\xe2\x80\x99s 1870 constitution permitted a poll tax, even the renowned white supremacist and former US president Andrew Johnson opposed it for its obvious potential to disfranchise poor whites, and a poll tax was not implemented by the state legislature until 1889. Still, Tennessee\xe2\x80\x99s poll tax was opt-in on an annual basis, lessening the potential to fully eliminate poor white voting. Mississippi followed suit with a $2.00 opt-in tax in its 1890 state constitution, while Arkansas adopted a $1.00 opt-in tax in 1892. While most Populists sought to repeal those poll taxes in the 1890s, the enforcement of them (along with blatant fraud) made it all but impossible for Populists to win major victories in those states.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en33" href="part0020.html#ch03en33e">33</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">A few straggler states joined the poll tax movement around the turn of the century. In North Carolina, after the Red Shirts\xe2\x80\x99 takeover in 1898, systemic disfranchisement of Black voters was the next logical step. As Josephus Daniels, a proud supporter of the Red Shirts and purveyor of baseless racial fearmongering in 1898, claimed, \xe2\x80\x9cThe greatest folly and crime in our national history was the establishment of negro suffrage immediately after the [Civil] War.

Of course, the satisfaction requirement provided ample latitude for discrimination.

A few sensational episodes reinforced the widespread idea among southern white Americans that alcohol turned otherwise docile Africans into rapacious, murderous monsters. \xe2\x80\x9c<span class="small-caps2">WHISKEY MAKES BLACK SLAYER THIRST FOR BLOOD</span>\xe2\x80\x9d reads the headline concerning Clarence Cooley, who murdered Johannes Hansen and Louis Teten after drinking two bottles of beer and a pint of whiskey. The article begins with a saloon that \xe2\x80\x9csoaked Clarence Cooley\xe2\x80\x99s black flesh with whiskey, fired his docile brain with the fumes of alcohol, and sent him forth to slay.\xe2\x80\x9d The article ends with words of warning from Cooley: \xe2\x80\x9cLet booze alone.

The article makes this explicit when it states the price of Cooley\xe2\x80\x99s drink and adds: \xe2\x80\x9cThat was the price of three human lives.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en60" href="part0020.html#ch03en60e">60</a></span> The story inspires the reader to take responsibility for the poor \xe2\x80\x9cnegroes\xe2\x80\x9d who cannot help but kill once they have a few drinks. White drys did not see African Americans as three-dimensional people but as objects of scorn and pity to be protected from booze.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">That story parallels an incident in Shreveport, Louisiana, where Charles Coleman, an African American man, was convicted and punctiliously hanged (legally) for raping and murdering a fourteen-year-old white girl, Margaret Lear. Coleman had been drunk. A reporter speculated (apparently without proof) that Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s drink had been \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Cock Vigor Gin,\xe2\x80\x9d an actual brand of cheap gin sold to African Americans that featured a scantily clad white woman.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en61" href="part0020.html#ch03en61e">61</a></span> According to a prohibitionist mindset, alcohol was to blame. By the same token, white drys argued that taking away alcohol would improve Black behavior and therefore reduce lynchings. In February 1928, <span class="italic">Home and State</span> printed a clipping stating that lynchings decreased due to prohibition, advancing the logic that proper legislation keeps alcohol out of the hands of Blacks and so keeps them docile.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en62" href="part0020.html#ch03en62e">62</a></span> For white drys, prohibition was yet another means to control the bodies of Black men.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">While one may interpret white evangelicals\xe2\x80\x99 prohibition advocacy as trying to reduce racial violence, it may equally be viewed as another form of racial control. Joe Coker contends that white evangelicals in the South promoted prohibition as a \xe2\x80\x9cpreemptive solution\xe2\x80\x9d to lynching which contributed to a \xe2\x80\x9cdecline in racial rhetoric.\xe2\x80\x9d Even so, he admits that white evangelicals were often \xe2\x80\x9cembracing and utilizing\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing racial attitudes of the region . . . for the advancement of prohibition.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en63" href="part0020.html#ch03en63e">63</a></span> In other words, even white drys\xe2\x80\x99 well-meaning efforts at avoiding unnecessary violence grew from an underlying commitment to white supremacism, and they deliberately used white-supremacist rhetoric to win over their white neighbors to prohibition.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">White media justified not only lynchings but other forms of extralegal violence against Black men with alcohol by depicting them as deviants particularly prone to criminal behavior. Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s shooting of Lundy in 1908 was not technically an attempted lynching because it was not done by a group of three or more people,<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en64" href="part0020.html#ch03en64e">64</a></span> but the incident illustrates this principle. As happened over a century later when unarmed Black men were shot by whites, some media outlets depicted the Black victim as a drug-tainted criminal and the white shooter as acting in self-defense. One <span class="italic">Washington Times</span> article, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cWounded Negro Has Bad Record in Police Court,\xe2\x80\x9d noted that Lundy \xe2\x80\x9chas been arrested time and again on charges of every character, and during the last few years much of his time has been spent in jail.\xe2\x80\x9d Offenses included carrying concealed weapons, petty larceny, and various incidents of drunkenness, disorderly conduct, and \xe2\x80\x9cviolating the police regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d The newspaper called Lundy \xe2\x80\x9csurly,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca source of constant trouble to the police,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cone of the most persistent lawbreakers and one of the most desperate negroes with whom the police have ever come in contact.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en65" href="part0020.html#ch03en65e">65</a></span> The paper also reported that Lundy was drunk or high when he reached the hospital and that it required six men to subdue him with anesthetic\xe2\x80\x94a clear parallel to latter-day warnings of drugs giving Black men unnatural strength. Heflin refused to speak to the press, but his authorized spokesman, fellow Alabama congressman Henry De Lamar Clayton Jr., claimed that Lundy was \xe2\x80\x9cunder the influence of gin, cocaine, or some other drug.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en66" href="part0020.html#ch03en66e">66</a></span> Such reports described Lundy as both \xe2\x80\x9cuppity\xe2\x80\x9d and under the influence: a not-so-subtle warning that Black men with alcohol threatened law and order, a standard white argument for prohibition.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">While major newspapers declined to interview the two Black men involved (or the white woman present) in Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s attempted homicide, close analysis of white accounts sufficiently undermines Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s self-defense claim. Clayton claimed that Heflin fought because the two Black men had planned to attack him. This theory made little sense, since the other Black man had earlier \xe2\x80\x9cattempted to take the flask away from\xe2\x80\x9d Lundy, showing that he was trying to defuse the situation by complying with Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s demand. While the <span class="italic">Times</span> stated that Heflin shoved and kicked Lundy off the car, South Carolina representative James Edwin Ellerbe claimed Heflin had scuffled with <span class="italic">both</span> men, who cursed Heflin \xe2\x80\x9cafter reaching the ground,\xe2\x80\x9d suggesting that Heflin had thrown them both off the car. Then Heflin fired while both men were on the ground\xe2\x80\x94hardly a position requiring Heflin to shoot in self-defense.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en67" href="part0020.html#ch03en67e">67</a></span> To the media of that time, however, the violence deserved no closer scrutiny: the Black man on drugs inherently deserved excessive force from a white elected official. White drys promised greater white control of such Black men.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">White drys sought to control not only Black men but also Black women who challenged the racial order. When Ida B. Wells denounced the lynchings of three African Americans in Memphis in 1892, Edward Ward Carmack, a prominent dry media personality, used his position as editor of the <span class="italic">Memphis Commercial</span> newspaper to malign her as \xe2\x80\x9cthe Black wench.\xe2\x80\x9d In what might reasonably be described as incitement to riot, Carmack called for retaliation against Wells for daring to oppose the system of racial terror they represented. An angry white mob answered his call and destroyed the offices of her paper, the<span class="italic"> Free Speech.</span> Fortunately, Wells was out of town at the time of the attack and so was unharmed, but the incident and subsequent death threats prompted her to live in exile in the North for thirty years. By inciting a mob against Wells, Carmack literally called for the destruction of <span class="italic">Free Speech</span> in the defense of white supremacism.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en68" href="part0020.html#ch03en68e">68</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Rather than hurting his reputation, the incident helped Carmack\xe2\x80\x99s political rise, and by 1908 he became the leader of the dry faction in the Democratic primary for Tennessee governor. He was only narrowly defeated by Malcolm R. Patterson, who led the state Democratic Party\xe2\x80\x99s wet faction. While Patterson easily won the general election, Carmack returned to working as a newspaper editor. In that role, Carmack launched several libelous attacks against a rival newspaperman, Duncan Brown Cooper. On November 9, 1908, when Cooper and his son encountered him on a Nashville street, Carmack opened fire. Carmack wounded Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s son, and Cooper shot Carmack dead. Carmack, who lived in vitriol and violence, became known as a \xe2\x80\x9cmartyr\xe2\x80\x9d for the dry cause and earned a posthumous statue in front of the Tennessee statehouse from 1925 until its removal in 2020.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en69" href="part0020.html#ch03en69e">69</a></span> Violence on behalf of white supremacism and one\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chonor\xe2\x80\x9d was a feature, not a bug, for southern white drys.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The \xe2\x80\x9cFather of American Prohibition,\xe2\x80\x9d Alabama US representative Richmond Pearson Hobson, likewise linked prohibition to white-supremacist views in his most famous dry speeches to Congress. In his famous \xe2\x80\x9cThe Great Destroyer\xe2\x80\x9d speech on the House floor in 1911, he spoke about \xe2\x80\x9c<span class="small-caps2">THE CURSE OF THE RED MAN AND BLACK MAN\xe2\x80\x9d</span> and argued: \xe2\x80\x9cIf a peaceable red man is subjected to the regular use of alcoholic beverage, he will speedily be put back to the plane of the savage.\xe2\x80\x9d The answer for such problem was, in his Progressive mind, using government force to coerce right behavior: he remarked approvingly that \xe2\x80\x9cThe Government long since recognized this and absolutely prohibits the introduction of alcoholic beverage into an Indian reservation.\xe2\x80\x9d Hobson extended such thinking to African Americans as well: \xe2\x80\x9cIf a negro takes up a regular use of alcohol beverage, in a short time he will degenerate to the level of a cannibal.\xe2\x80\x9d Hobson conceded that liquor was not only a problem for racial minorities but also could affect \xe2\x80\x9cthe noblest white men\xe2\x80\x9d regardless \xe2\x80\x9chow high the stage of evolution.\xe2\x80\x9d Even this supposedly more-evolved white man with corresponding \xe2\x80\x9cgreat self-control,\xe2\x80\x9d who is \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderate, tenderhearted, who would not willingly harm an insect, will be degenerated by regular use of alcoholic beverage to the point where he will strike with a dagger or fire a shot to kill with little or no provocation.\xe2\x80\x9d The description of shooting to kill with little cause seemed an apt description of Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s attack on Lundy in 1908, a sober white man assaulting a Black man having alcohol. However, for white southern drys such as Hobson, alcohol was the prime culprit for such danger, and nonwhites were particularly \xe2\x80\x9ccursed\xe2\x80\x9d with the vulnerability to descend to \xe2\x80\x9csavagery\xe2\x80\x9d and lose their \xe2\x80\x9cself-control, self-respect, the sense of honor, [and] the moral sense.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en70" href="part0020.html#ch03en70e">70</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">In a similar speech in 1914 entitled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Truth about Alcohol,\xe2\x80\x9d Hobson repeated and expanded on these white-supremacist themes. He claimed that alcohol has made \xe2\x80\x9ctwice as many slaves, largely white men, today than there were black men slaves in America at any one time.\xe2\x80\x9d In addition to minimizing the extreme terror and torture experienced by real slaves, he literally did not count the suffering of enslaved women and children in his \xe2\x80\x9cblack men slaves\xe2\x80\x9d calculation.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en71" href="part0020.html#ch03en71e">71</a></span> He also bemoaned a \xe2\x80\x9cgrowing degenerate vote directly due to liquor\xe2\x80\x9d which menaced not only large cities but also the whole nation.

His second speech, while also claiming that liquor could take the same effect on white men (though, \xe2\x80\x9cbeing further evolved it takes [a] longer time to reduce him to the same level\xe2\x80\x9d), now omits the old reference to drunken white men stabbing and shooting.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en74" href="part0020.html#ch03en74e">74</a></span> Hobson, prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s greatest promoter in the US House and an outspoken Progressive from the South, emphasized white suffering from alcohol, stirred fears of \xe2\x80\x9cdegenerate\xe2\x80\x9d voters, increasingly stressed the threat of violence against whites from drunken African Americans and Amerindians, and muted his earlier concerns of violence committed by drunken whites. In short, the South\xe2\x80\x99s most prominent dry linked prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s success in the 1910s more and more to control of nonwhite bodies and votes.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Many drys, including Mexican Americans and Black Americans, linked prohibition to the rule of \xe2\x80\x9cbetter\xe2\x80\x9d social classes. The racial order articulated by Texan drys in <span class="italic">Home and State</span> assumed at least as much cultural and class superiority as racial superiority. Various articles in the paper argued against \xe2\x80\x9cthe low negro and Mexican vote,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cMexican and ignorant negro,\xe2\x80\x9d and the like.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en75" href="part0020.html#ch03en75e">75</a></span> However, many drys distinguished between \xe2\x80\x9clow\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbetter\xe2\x80\x9d minorities, especially regarding Mexicans and African Americans. A 1912 <span class="italic">Home and State </span>article entitled \xe2\x80\x9cOur Mexican \xe2\x80\x98Citizens\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d focused on \xe2\x80\x9cthe ignorant and unpatriotic Mexicans known as the \xe2\x80\x98Greaser Class.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d The author recognized that \xe2\x80\x9camong our Mexican citizenship there are many first-class men and women who are educated, intelligent, and loyal to our government and its situations,\xe2\x80\x9d but in the rest of the article \xe2\x80\x9cno reference whatever is made to that [first] class.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en76" href="part0020.html#ch03en76e">76</a></span> In the context of a dry paper, such terms as \xe2\x80\x9ceducated, intelligent, and loyal\xe2\x80\x9d were synonymous with prohibition while \xe2\x80\x9cignorant and unpatriotic\xe2\x80\x9d signified opposing it. Mexican Americans may have been generally regarded with contempt by white Texans, but some dry whites saw middle-class dry Mexican Americans as respectable, in contrast with the wet majority.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Similarly, some African American clergy gained white favor by backing prohibition. Before white drys had opted for prohibition via Jim Crow, a good number of leading African Americans were dry. Rayner, Bishop Turner, and the Rev. J. W.

They followed in the tradition of Booker T. Washington, who tried to uplift his race by deferring to the southern racial order while seeking advancement through gradually expanding economic and practical educational opportunities.

Edwin DuBose Mouzon, a relatively progressive Southern Methodist bishop from Texas who promoted prohibition vigorously, confessed to his fellow bishop James Cannon Jr. in 1919 that \xe2\x80\x9cthe negro is not in point of morals, or education, or religion, the equal of the white man, and to place him in the church on a position of equality would be a wrong to the negro and to the church.\xe2\x80\x9d For his part, Cannon, who led the Virginia ASL to dry the state by 1916, expressed similar views. He described \xe2\x80\x9cthe negroes as a people\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ca child race\xe2\x80\x94immature, not fully developed\xe2\x80\x9d and justified extralegal action against \xe2\x80\x9cbrute beasts . . . whose brutal assaults on white woman bring on rioting and bloodshed.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en82" href="part0020.html#ch03en82e">82</a></span> White evangelical drys may have occasionally welcomed Black support but believed whites should rule the church as well as the state.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Drying the Southland</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Given the increasingly clear connection between white churches, white supremacy, and prohibition, most southern states turned dry within a few years, from 1908 to 1915. Georgia went dry on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day in 1908, and throughout that year several southern states opted to begin prohibition on January 1, 1909. After Birmingham\xe2\x80\x99s Jefferson County went dry by nearly eighteen hundred votes on Oct. 28, 1907, Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s legislature decided that the writing was on the wall and voted for statewide prohibition that November. Mississippi\xe2\x80\x99s legislature followed suit in February 1908.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en83" href="part0020.html#ch03en83e">83</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">North Carolina distinguished itself by becoming the first southern state to opt for statewide prohibition by popular vote in 1908. The dry side brought together such unlikely allies as Governor Robert Broadnax Glenn and US Judge Jeter Connelly Pritchard, who had taken opposite sides on disputes about railroad monopolies. Nearly all of the state\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic congressmen also joined the drys. So, it was unsurprising that on Tuesday, May 26, 1908, North Carolinians voted for prohibition by a margin so large that newspapers predicted its victory before watching official results come in. With North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s vote, half of the eight states in the nation that approved statewide prohibition were in the South\xe2\x80\x94most if one includes the new state of Oklahoma.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en84" href="part0020.html#ch03en84e">84</a></span> While only three states nationwide (none of them southern) had statewide prohibition in effect at the start of 1907, within two years the South had leaped to the forefront of the movement.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The next several years demonstrated rapid progress for drys in the South. As with Mississippi and Alabama, North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s dry law went into effect on January 1, 1909, and the year saw more successes for the drys across the South. On January 19, the Tennessee legislature overrode the governor\xe2\x80\x99s veto to ban alcohol within four miles of schools and ban alcohol production in state, which took effect the next year. In August 1909, a South Carolina election enacted partial statewide prohibition, allowing counties to opt out, and only six counties opted to stay wet with government-run alcohol dispensaries.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en85" href="part0020.html#ch03en85e">85</a></span> While a prohibition amendment to Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s constitution was defeated by the voters in November 1909, the state remained officially dry, even if dry laws were not consistently enforced.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en86" href="part0020.html#ch03en86e">86</a></span> <span>Tables 5 and 6</span> give a fuller timeline for the success of prohibition in the region.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">One constant throughout these campaigns for white drys was control of African Americans.

After the dramatic failure of attempts at interracial cooperation in the 1880s, white drys increasingly tended towards the exclusion of racial minorities from politics by intimidation and Jim Crow laws. Unabashed race-baiting grew increasingly effective in advancing prohibition in the South.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">However, white drys encountered significant opposition in the 1900s and early 1910s. Christians of all races continued to resist Gin Crow\xe2\x80\x99s infringement of their God-given liberties. Black voters defied the Jim Crow laws that limited their voting rights and worked together with brewers to inflict stinging defeats on the drys. This multiracial and religiously infused wet coalition won a string of statewide votes that humiliated drys from one end of the South to the other during the early days of Jim Crow.</p>\n</body></html>\n'</p>

More importantly, though, southern white drys endorsed Jim Crow laws in the 1890s in part because they believed it was the only reliable path to prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s success. The attempted interracial prohibition coalitions in the 1880s failed, leading white drys to blame Black voters for their failures. White drys increasingly sought to advance white supremacy through the punitive legal measures of Jim Crow, particularly voter suppression. Concern with suppressing Black votes permeated the publications of white drys. Many whites worried aloud that the prohibition issue could divide the white vote and so give a decisive role to African American voters in elections.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Because of the hardening of racial views among most white drys, African American participation in local and statewide prohibition elections during the early Jim Crow period was effectively a form of resistance to Jim Crow. White supremacists had effectively used Jim Crow laws to disfranchise the majority of African Americans by the first decade of the twentieth century, and white Democrats exercised a stranglehold on statewide offices and state legislatures throughout the region. Black men found in the wet movement at least one issue on which to ally with a powerful, white-dominated industry\xe2\x80\x94brewers and distillers\xe2\x80\x94to wield real political influence and protect Black suffrage. Even white supremacists in the wet coalition unwittingly helped to prop up interracial politics by protecting the alcohol lobby, which fought more to mobilize Black voters and to subvert Jim Crow poll taxes than any other white industry at the time. To oppose Gin Crow (southern prohibition) was to oppose Jim Crow, and that opposition was stronger and went longer than scholars have previously thought possible. Still, Black turnout eventually succumbed to voter-suppression tactics, dooming the region to Gin Crow.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Once statewide and national prohibition took effect, not only did law enforcement disproportionately target Black Americans for violations of dry laws, but white Protestant attacks against traditionally wet Catholics increased, particularly in the presidential election of 1928. The \xe2\x80\x9cSolid South\xe2\x80\x9d broke, with half of the formerly Confederate states joining with the GOP. The Democratic Party in the South had switched from \xe2\x80\x9cRebels, Rum, and Romanism\xe2\x80\x9d to rebels against rum and Romanism.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">While Black men lost suffrage, white women gained it. The Eighteenth and Nineteenth Amendments, for prohibition and women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage, had gone hand in hand, and many dry men granted women the vote mostly because they hoped women would never permit alcohol\xe2\x80\x99s return by the ballot box. However, the failure of prohibition to bring a promised utopia, particularly during the Great Depression, prompted respectable women to organize against prohibition. From the first woman elected governor, Texan Miriam \xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x9d Ferguson, to the Alabama organizer Pattie Ruffner Jacobs, southern women played leading roles in challenging assumptions that white women would always embrace prohibition.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Unlike the contests over prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, repeal in the South came with little discussion of race and virtually no major Black involvement. Even the Republican Party in the South, once a staunch defender of Black rights, had turned from a multiracial \xe2\x80\x9cblack-and-tan\xe2\x80\x9d coalition to a lily-white institution. Gin Crow finally fell in part because it was no longer needed: Jim Crow laws had effectively disfranchised African Americans and imposed white supremacy. Before then, however, white drys had indelibly linked prohibition in the South with Jim Crow.</p>\n</body></html>\n'</p>

RAYNER\xe2\x80\x99S LETTER</span> of March 17, 1887, was political dynamite. He wrote to Dr. Benajah Harvey Carroll, a fellow Baptist minister and the white leader of the Texas drys, that to win the upcoming election on statewide prohibition he needed Black support. Rayner, a self-professed \xe2\x80\x9cProhibitionist by deep religious principle\xe2\x80\x9d and fellow Baptist, warned Carroll that \xe2\x80\x9cthe negro vote is quite an item and will play an important part in the coming election.\xe2\x80\x9d Rayner, an African American himself, advised Carroll how best to win the Black vote: enlist as many African American ministers and newspapermen as possible.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en1" href="part0020.html#ch02en1e">1</a></span> Soon thereafter, prominent Black ministers, including African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Bishop Henry McNeal Turner of Georgia, were campaigning in the state for prohibition.

Interracial cooperation seemed to be working until early June, when wets obtained Rayner\xe2\x80\x99s secret letter and published it. One wet editor accused, \xe2\x80\x9cThat Rayner letter and the presence of Bishop Turner needs, nay, demands explanation,\xe2\x80\x9d and concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cPolitics which mix up religions [<span class="italic">sic</span>] like that are dark and peculiar, and Dr. Carroll ought not to be in the business.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en3" href="part0020.html#ch02en3e">3</a></span> As with other prominent prohibition votes that year around the South, the Texas vote led to loss for the drys and resulted in white backlash to multiracial politics.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Prohibitionists in the 1880s South fought an uphill battle not only against racial conventions but also against gender norms. While southern traditions in the postbellum period put white women on a pedestal yet denied them basic civil rights, drys drew much of their support from women, both white and Black, and many drys advocated for women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage. Women used the temperance movement to denounce abuse in the home and justify public activism as a necessary extension of their domestic sphere. Black women also sought racial uplift, middle-class solidarity, and feminine respectability by making common cause with their white sisters for prohibition. The intertwined social constructions of race and gender in the conservative Bourbon South militated against prohibition, particularly when it aligned with political empowerment for women and African Americans. Prohibition was too radical and transgressive for the 1880s South. To understand why the interracial prohibition campaigns of the 1880s mostly failed, however, one must first consider an essential piece of context: the racial history of prohibition in the Old South.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Origins of Southern Prohibition</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s slow progress in the Bourbon South stemmed in part from its old association with controlling nonwhite bodies. Long before most white southerners seriously contemplated limiting the access of fellow whites to alcoholic beverages, colonial legislatures in the South passed laws prohibiting the sale of alcohol to African American slaves. In the wake of the Stono Rebellion the year before, South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s Slave Code of 1740 included such a provision. Section XXII strictly forbade a retailer to \xe2\x80\x9cgive, sell, utter or deliver to any slave, any beer, ale, cider, wine, rum, brandy, or other spirituous liquors, or strong liquor whatsoever, without the license or consent of the owner, or such other person who shall have the care or government of such slave.\xe2\x80\x9d Punishment for violation included payment, increasing for repeated offenses, which could result in up to three months of jail time.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en4" href="part0020.html#ch02en4e">4</a></span> In this respect, the colonial South was not distinctive from the colonial North. Massachusetts also had a law against selling spirits to any \xe2\x80\x9cNegro, Indian or mulatto slave\xe2\x80\x9d in 1751.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en5" href="part0020.html#ch02en5e">5</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Aside from slaves, colonial prohibition laws also targeted Amerindians. Despite believing that moderate alcohol consumption was \xe2\x80\x9cwholesome and necessary\xe2\x80\x9d for whites, British colonists across North America sought \xe2\x80\x9cto reduce and finally prohibit the sale or gift of intoxicating liquors\xe2\x80\x9d to indigenous peoples. According to Anti-Saloon League statistician and historian Ernest H. Cherrington, alcohol wrought \xe2\x80\x9chavoc\xe2\x80\x9d among Amerindians, indicating \xe2\x80\x9cclearly and emphatically their possibilities for evil\xe2\x80\x9d and proving that \xe2\x80\x9cit was all but impossible for the Red Man to drink in what the white man considered moderation.\xe2\x80\x9d Colonists cared about this issue regarding Amerindian alcohol abuse only because \xe2\x80\x9cserious trouble with the savages . . . menaced the safety of the whites.\xe2\x80\x9d Besides indigenous peoples, servants (including slaves) were also targeted for alcohol bans, since their drunkenness stole the labor that \xe2\x80\x9cbelong[ed] to others.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en6" href="part0020.html#ch02en6e">6</a></span> The only colony that banned ardent spirits (distilled beverages) outright was Georgia, but even that was linked to class: it began as a penal colony, and the restrictions on alcohol were lifted in the 1750s, when restrictions on slavery were also lifted.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en7" href="part0020.html#ch02en7e">7</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The Old South had a few temperance organizations, but they failed to achieve much success in laws restricting alcohol sales, except for slaves.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en8" href="part0020.html#ch02en8e">8</a></span> And, as Lee L. Willis put it, slaves across the region \xe2\x80\x9calready lived under prohibition\xe2\x80\x9d before emancipation.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en9" href="part0020.html#ch02en9e">9</a></span> Tennessee\xe2\x80\x99s 1838 \xe2\x80\x9cquart law,\xe2\x80\x9d the first ban on selling small quantities of intoxicating beverages in the United States, had only a modest impact. The quart law allowed purchases of larger quantities, resulting in effective prohibition for the poor but not the rich. The state legislature repealed the quart law in 1846 and replaced it with the old licensing system, along with a requirement that liquor dealers had to swear to not sell to slaves, allow gambling, or sell drinks on Sundays. The quart law was briefly reinstated between 1856 and 1857 before finally being consigned to oblivion.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en10" href="part0020.html#ch02en10e">10</a></span> As with the quart law, Mississippi enacted in 1839 a \xe2\x80\x9cgallon law\xe2\x80\x9d to ban liquor sales of less than a gallon. The law\xe2\x80\x99s severe penalties\xe2\x80\x94a $200 fine and at least a week in jail for a first offense, $500 and a least a month in jail for subsequent convictions\xe2\x80\x94prompted an angry mob to burn the law\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor, Henry S. Foote, in effigy in Jackson. The gallon law was replaced in 1842 by a law allowing sales by a licensed liquor seller\xe2\x80\x94who had to be \xe2\x80\x9ca free white person.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en11" href="part0020.html#ch02en11e">11</a></span> Texas acquired an early taste for dry laws as well. In 1843, the Republic of Texas passed the first local option law in North America, allowing cities and counties to vote to ban alcohol for themselves. An 1845 Texas law banned saloons, though it was never enforced and was repealed by 1856. Prohibition laws in the Antebellum South were limited in scope, faced tremendous backlash, and were invariably repealed.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en12" href="part0020.html#ch02en12e">12</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">When racial chattel slavery was overthrown by the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution, former Confederates sought to salvage white supremacy through Black Codes to control Black labor\xe2\x80\x94and drinking habits. A Mississippi law from November 1865 stated that any person of color who was convicted of selling \xe2\x80\x9cspirituous or intoxicating liquors\xe2\x80\x9d would be fined between ten and one hundred dollars and could be imprisoned up to thirty days, while any white person convicted of providing a person of color with weapons or an intoxicating drink could be fined up to fifty dollars and faced imprisonment of up to thirty days. Likewise, a South Carolina law in December 1865 prohibited African Americans from owning even part of a business that distilled or sold spirituous liquors or being employed as a distiller or seller of those drinks. While that act punished a person of color who engaged in such business with beating or hard labor at the discretion of a district judge or magistrate, there was no punishment for a white distiller who employed that person of color. Slave codes sought to control slaves\xe2\x80\x99 drinking habits through coercing white collaborators while benignly neglecting free Blacks, yet the Black Codes directly targeted alcohol access for all people of color.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en13" href="part0020.html#ch02en13e">13</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Given the racial connotations of alcohol control in the South, it is unsurprising that the prohibition movement originated in the North and initially met resistance in Dixie. In the early nineteenth century, the temperance movement was one of many causes, including abolitionism, developed and advanced by the evangelical reform nexus in the North. The Union victory in the Civil War brought some of these northern reform-minded evangelicals South through organizations such as the American Tract Society, African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church (AMEZ), American Baptist Home Mission Society, the American Missionary Association, and the National Temperance Society. While most of these groups were organized by whites, the AME and AMEZ were Black-led denominations, and all of these groups sought to provide African Americans in the South with spiritual and practical assistance. Missionary schools, public schools, churches, and fraternal lodges all encouraged Black leaders to embrace the convictions of the northern evangelical reform nexus, including alcohol prohibition, thus linking racial uplift with interracial reform.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en14" href="part0020.html#ch02en14e">14</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">While laws targeting Black drinking disappeared under Congressional Reconstruction in the late 1860s and early 1870s, dry groups formed around the South. In addition to many of the antebellum reformist organizations mentioned above, other groups also came South and had chapters throughout the region by 1870, including: United Friends of Temperance, International Order of Good Templars, Sons of Temperance, Band of Hope, and Temperance Council. Dry newspapers such as Houston\xe2\x80\x99s <span class="italic">Temperance Family Visitor</span> (around 1871) cropped up around the South, and other local press gained sympathy for the movement.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en15" href="part0020.html#ch02en15e">15</a></span> The prohibitionist impulse was not limited to African Americans and so-called carpetbaggers but began taking root among southern whites.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">After Reconstruction, white-supremacist Democrats wrote new state constitutions, many of which introduced local option laws. These laws, promoted by Jeffersonian Democrats and prohibitionists, empowered cities, counties, and other locales to prohibit or allow alcohol within their borders, usually by plebiscite. This arrangement produced a patchwork quilt of fully wet, bone-dry, and mixed \xe2\x80\x9cmoist\xe2\x80\x9d locales across southern states, with towns and counties sometimes flipping back and forth between banning and legalizing alcohol. Some states resisted local option, such as Tennessee, which did not include it in the 1870 constitution, and the state\xe2\x80\x99s governor in 1873 vetoed a local option law.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en16" href="part0020.html#ch02en16e">16</a></span> Yet other states embraced the Jeffersonian arrangement of local option votes. Alabama had twenty-two dry counties by 1874. The 1876 Texas Constitution permitted local option laws, finding first success when Jasper County voted to go dry in December of that year.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The local option laws in several southern states, though modest in practical scope, marked a turning point for prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s racial dimension in the region. For the first time in southern history, blanket prohibition laws were imposed with votes from all the people they affected, including people of color. African Americans in the South, who had for generations been told by white overlords what they could not drink, could now vote in elections determining not only their own right to drink, but the rights of their white neighbors as well. For Black voters, postbellum prohibition contests offered a heady cocktail of freedom and power.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Meanwhile, many southern white evangelicals also came to appreciate the empowering possibilities and moral necessity of prohibition reform by the 1880s. While the connection of prohibition with causes such as abolition impeded its progress among southern whites before the Civil War, the end of slavery and then the end of Reconstruction by 1877 encouraged white evangelicals to focus less on securing white dominance through Democratic rule (which had already been achieved) and more on expanding their moral authority. Despite persisting regional denominational divides among Methodists and Baptists, many white evangelical clergy and laity sought to cooperate with their northern co-religionists to institute a sort of moral reconstruction in the decades after 1877. By the 1890s, white southern evangelicals\xe2\x80\x99 priorities mirrored the evangelical reform nexus, with most southern federal legislators backing laws against gambling and polygamy and for closing the World\xe2\x80\x99s Fair on Sunday.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en17" href="part0020.html#ch02en17e">17</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">This transformation among white evangelicals took time. Robert Wuthnow argues that Texas churches were for most of the nineteenth century too focused on bringing order to a wild frontier by building institutions and instilling moral character to invest much in direct political activism, but by the early twentieth century, the landscape had changed. Fostered especially by Baptists and Methodists, the notion of liberty of conscience became a major part of civil religion, and both wets and drys claimed to uphold individual rights. Wets argued that each person should have free reign over whether to drink, but the church had no place demanding laws to force compliance with religious teaching. Drys, however, defended individuals\xe2\x80\x99 right to live upright lives free from alcohol addiction and moral degradation. Prohibitionists also argued that saloons corrupted politics through their collusion with political machines, that brewers and distillers were dominated by \xe2\x80\x9cforeigners\xe2\x80\x9d who undermined American liberty, and that leading dry organizations were not churches but nonsectarian and nonpartisan. By framing themselves as warriors for heaven and the homeland above the everyday fray of politics, drys increased their political clout and cultural influence as they sought to reshape the South in their own image.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en18" href="part0020.html#ch02en18e">18</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-a">Threats to Bourbon Rule: African Americans and Women</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">The interracial prohibition movement in the South occurred in the broader context of other political threats to conservative Democratic rule in the South. During Reconstruction, African Americans experienced a new birth of freedom through emancipation, citizenship rights, public education, modest economic opportunities, the franchise, and\xe2\x80\x94for the select few\xe2\x80\x94offices in local, state, and federal government. Though white supremacists denounced \xe2\x80\x9cblack rule\xe2\x80\x9d during Reconstruction, African Americans very rarely made up more than a minority of state and local officers in any given state at any time. Nonetheless, the elevation of Black Americans from slaves to state officials in a few short years surprised everyone in the South. Coupled with support from white Republicans\xe2\x80\x94both northern-born \xe2\x80\x9ccarpetbaggers\xe2\x80\x9d and southern-born \xe2\x80\x9cscalawags\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94African Americans held the balance of political power in every state that underwent Congressional Reconstruction.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Since Republican rule in the Reconstruction-era South depended upon interracial coalitions of whites and Blacks, white-supremacist Democrats employed terrorism, intimidation, trickery, and fraud to wrest control in state after state. By 1877, all the formerly Confederate states were under Democratic control and remained so until the mid-twentieth century, nearly a century later. While Republicans still held some seats in localities, state legislatures, and even Congress, their representation dwindled. Southern white Republicans debated whether to have an interracial \xe2\x80\x9cBlack and tan\xe2\x80\x9d party or go \xe2\x80\x9clily-white\xe2\x80\x9d to have a chance at power, and eventually the lily-whites won out. By the 1890s, interracial politics in the South appeared finished.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Before southern Republicans had completed their abandonment of African Americans, the most serious opposition to conservative Bourbon rule in the early post-Reconstruction South came from a movement outside of the Republican Party. Founded by the former Confederate general and railroad tycoon William Mahone, the Readjuster Party from 1879 to 1883 dominated Virginia state politics. When the Virginia Republican Party collapsed in the state after the election of 1877, the dominant Conservative Party (essentially Democrats), called \xe2\x80\x9cFunders\xe2\x80\x9d for their intent to pay the state\xe2\x80\x99s debt in full at a fixed interest rate, dominated the state legislature and angered poorer Democrats who sought to refinance the state\xe2\x80\x99s debt and so reduce the burden of repayment on taxpayers. Mahone saw an opportunity to win over disaffected Democrats and disorganized Republicans by forming a new party, named Readjusters because of their commitment to readjusting payment of the state\xe2\x80\x99s debt. In addition to controlling the state legislature, the Readjusters elected five men to the US House, two to the US Senate\xe2\x80\x94Mahone in 1880 and Harrison Holt Riddleberger in 1882\xe2\x80\x94and a governor, William Evelyn Cameron. While limited to Virginia, this new party posed the most serious challenge at that time to Bourbon rule anywhere in the South.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en19" href="part0020.html#ch02en19e">19</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The Readjusters not only challenged the economic order but also promoted interracial political cooperation. In addition to other issues, the Readjusters abolished public whippings and ended Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s poll tax, both of which disproportionately burdened African Americans. By 1881, one-third of delegates to the statewide Readjuster convention were African Americans, and the white delegates mingled with their Black compatriots on terms of casual equality. As Nicole Meyers Turner observes, Mahone courted support from Black churches, who in turn played a crucial role in providing margins of victory for the Readjusters in the 1881 governor\xe2\x80\x99s election. But no good thing lasts forever. The Readjusters lost heavily in the 1883 elections when Democrats rallied most of the state\xe2\x80\x99s whites around the banner of white supremacy, and Readjusters lost their political clout in subsequent votes. Mahone\xe2\x80\x99s 1885 bid for governor likewise resulted in defeat. Like the Populist-Republican Fusionists in North Carolina in the 1890s, Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s Readjusters were a potent interracial political threat to Bourbon Democratic rule, and white supremacists put down the threat ruthlessly.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">A lesser but potential threat to white-only Democratic rule in the 1880s South was the nascent Prohibition Party. Founded in 1869 by members of the Independent Order of Good Templars, the National Prohibition Party originated in northern states and has fielded a presidential candidate ever since 1872, making it the oldest extant national third party in the United States. However, the Prohibition Party never gained much traction in the South because most southern white drys were Democrats. They saw other parties as a potential threat to white-only rule by splitting the vote and giving racial minorities the power to swing elections. B. H. Carroll, a faithful Democrat, represented this \xe2\x80\x9cnon-political\xe2\x80\x9d strain of dry activism in the South, though he worked with Black allies such as Rayner to win African American votes in special prohibition elections. By contrast, Carroll\xe2\x80\x99s friend and fellow Southern Baptist minister, J. B. Cranfill, was a \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical\xe2\x80\x9d prohibitionist because he backed the Prohibition Party. Though Carroll\xe2\x80\x99s stance, by far the more typical of white southern drys, sought to distance prohibition from partisan politics, Carroll\xe2\x80\x99s articles for Cranfill\xe2\x80\x99s newspaper in the 1880s helped wets paint all prohibitionists as anti-Democratic.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en20" href="part0020.html#ch02en20e">20</a></span> While the specter of the prohibition question splitting the white vote and giving a decisive role to Black voters frightened some white southerners, it roused African Americans who saw an opportunity to regain the political clout they enjoyed during Reconstruction.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Looking back from the perspective of 1920, the ASL\xe2\x80\x99s Ernest H. Cherrington concluded that the Prohibition Party could never have succeeded as a party but succeeded in its great cause. From his perspective, the Prohibition Party founders \xe2\x80\x9cwere not politicians; they were crusaders.\xe2\x80\x9d While \xe2\x80\x9cPartyism\xe2\x80\x9d depends upon \xe2\x80\x9copportunism\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cattract the largest number of voters,\xe2\x80\x9d the Prohibition Party faithful \xe2\x80\x9cnever knew the meaning of policy, prudence, or diplomacy.\xe2\x80\x9d He further reflected that party loyalty was too strong. \xe2\x80\x9cChristian voters who are favorable to prohibition refuse nevertheless to leave the political party with which they are affiliated and vote for a new party, although that party may advocate the thing in which they believe.\xe2\x80\x9d Though the Prohibition Party failed, they laid the groundwork for others to finish the work through \xe2\x80\x9ca great non-partisan political movement\xe2\x80\x9d that allowed \xe2\x80\x9cmen to remain in their own political parties and yet give political expression to their Prohibition sentiment.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en21" href="part0020.html#ch02en21e">21</a></span> Yet the Prohibition Party stood not only for bans on alcohol, but also on suffrage for the most reliably dry demographic: women.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Women\xe2\x80\x99s Christian Temperance</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Women turned the nation\xe2\x80\x99s attention to temperance in the 1870s and 1880s. A dramatic combination of prayer and social action took place in the \xe2\x80\x9cwoman\xe2\x80\x99s crusade,\xe2\x80\x9d when Eliza Jane Thompson led dozens of women on a tour of Ohio towns in December 1873 and early 1874 to kneel, pray, and sing in front of saloons until they shut down. This \xe2\x80\x9cWhirlwind of the Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d as Frances Willard later called it, led directly to the creation of the Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in 1874. Originally led by Annie Turner Wittenmyer, the WCTU grew to over a thousand chapters around the nation in five years.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The WCTU had focused exclusively on anti-alcohol activism until 1879, when Frances Willard became president and broadened the organization\xe2\x80\x99s focus to include women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage. Willard justified the controversial goal of votes for women as a necessary means of \xe2\x80\x9cHome Protection\xe2\x80\x9d from the abuse, neglect, and family decline wrought by drunken husbands and fathers. Frances Willard, a devout Methodist, believed the idea was God-given during a prayer. Under her leadership, hundreds of thousands of women across the nation, including many culturally conservative women, joined in an activist movement for the twin radical reforms of women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage and alcohol prohibition. The activism of Christian women suggested a holy alliance between women\xe2\x80\x99s activism and the explicitly Christian purification of culture.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en22" href="part0020.html#ch02en22e">22</a></span> While the first wave of temperance activism had little impact on the South, this second wave begun by the WCTU finally began making serious inroads in the US South.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Many women, both Black and white, despite not having the right to vote, also campaigned for prohibition, though for different reasons. White women drys were divided between radicals like Willard and conservatives, who dominated the WCTU in the South. In 1881, Willard made a tour of the South, including North Carolina during a statewide prohibition election, mobilizing WCTU women to advance the twin goals of prohibition and women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage. \xe2\x80\x9cEverywhere the Southern white people desired me to speak to the colored,\xe2\x80\x9d Willard recalled, but her aims differed from her white Democratic hosts. Willard desired to \xe2\x80\x9cliberate the suppressed colored vote\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdivide the white vote on the issues\xe2\x80\x9d and make a partisan \xe2\x80\x9crealignment\xe2\x80\x9d uniting drys North and South.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en23" href="part0020.html#ch02en23e">23</a></span> In short, Willard advocated for a multiracial Prohibition Party to challenge Republicans and Democrats alike.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Willard\xe2\x80\x99s radical advocacy for the Prohibition Party led to the founding of a nonpartisan WCTU by Judith Ellen Foster. The first woman admitted to practice law in Iowa in 1872, Foster served as a delegate to the first WCTU convention in 1874 and rose to become a legal advisor to the organization by 1880. Though like Willard she was a Methodist and a proponent of women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage, Foster objected to Willard aligning the WCTU with the Prohibition Party for a simple reason: she was a dedicated Republican. In protest of its support for the Prohibition Party, she resigned from the national WCTU in 1884 and soon became the president of the Iowa state chapter. In 1888, she founded the Woman\xe2\x80\x99s National Republican Association and served as its president until her death in 1910. Frustrated by the WCTU\xe2\x80\x99s continued support for the Prohibition Party, she led the Iowa state chapter to split from the national WCTU in 1889 and founded a Non-Partisan National WCTU in 1890. The latter group never posed a serious threat to the dominance of the main WCTU, and the two groups reconciled after Willard\xe2\x80\x99s death in 1898. Though temporary, the split revealed the difficulty of holding a third party together around prohibition when women could advance their interests within the two-party system.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en24" href="part0020.html#ch02en24e">24</a></span> While northern white women like Foster sought to link prohibition with the Republican Party, most southern white women sought to tie their cause to the Democratic Party, which stood for white-supremacist rule.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">For their part, many Black women sought prohibition not only for \xe2\x80\x9cHome Protection\xe2\x80\x9d from alcoholic men but also for racial uplift. The WCTU offered a respectable forum for activism and represented middle-class womanhood. For women subject to both sexual and racial double standards, asserting their Victorian morality while organizing for social reform alongside prominent white allies (particularly northern radicals like Willard) could seem very attractive. One leading Black voice in the North Carolina WCTU was Sarah Dudly Pettey, who electrified mixed-gender crowds with her oratory. One Black man cited her as a fine example of \xe2\x80\x9cwomanly womanhood\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca brilliant Frances Willard.\xe2\x80\x9d In short, African American women joined the WCTU primarily to assert their equality with middle-class Christian whites.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en25" href="part0020.html#ch02en25e">25</a></span> While they were not opposed in principle to interracial politics and women\xe2\x80\x99s enfranchisement, which the Prohibition Party supported, many Black women preferred to back the Republican Party, which offered more practical avenues for racial uplift.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">More conservative southern white women, meanwhile, seemed more interested in preserving racial hierarchy through the Democratic Party even as they reached out across the color line for votes on prohibition. For example, the white women running a prohibition club meeting in a Methodist church in Concord, North Carolina, in June 1881 invited Black women\xe2\x80\x94to segregated seating in the balcony.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en26" href="part0020.html#ch02en26e">26</a></span> The ordering spoke loud and clear: white women wanted support from Blacks, but only as inferiors. After the 1881 statewide vote, the WCTU in North Carolina organized white and Black chapters, resulting in a state structure in which chapters of both races interacted as equals. However, as Glenda Elizabeth Gilmore has observed, southern white women saw African American women as their inferiors. By 1883, when Willard returned to the state, she anointed white supremacy by how she reorganized the local chapters into a statewide structure. All Black chapters were shunted into a department called \xe2\x80\x9cWork amongst the Colored People,\xe2\x80\x9d which was led by a white woman.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en27" href="part0020.html#ch02en27e">27</a></span> Formerly engaging as near-equals, Black women in the WCTU were now treated as objects of missionary work and racial uplift under white supervision: separate and clearly unequal.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">An 1889 schism in North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s WCTU illustrated the difficulties of interracial cooperation on prohibition. Since the \xe2\x80\x9cWork amongst the Colored People\xe2\x80\x9d was founded in 1883, the department head, Rosa Steele, was a white New England\xe2\x80\x93born Methodist. She moved south when her husband, Professor Wilbur Steele, took a position teaching at a Black school. He later took a leading role in the state\xe2\x80\x99s Prohibition Party, and the couple sometimes dined with Black friends, for which the white press attacked him as \xe2\x80\x9cSocial Equality\xe2\x80\x9d Steele.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en28" href="part0020.html#ch02en28e">28</a></span> Despite these credentials for interracial work, Rosa Steele adopted a paternalistic approach, critiquing Black chapters that organized and operated without white oversight, though in many cases no white women would volunteer for those positions. In 1888, Steele invited Sarah Jane Woodson Early, the Black superintendent of the national WCTU\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cColored Work for the South,\xe2\x80\x9d to North Carolina. After five weeks of Early\xe2\x80\x99s campaign (funded by Black women), fourteen Black WCTU chapters stood strong around the state. Encouraged by Early\xe2\x80\x99s example and wearied by years of second-class treatment, these chapters seceded from the white-controlled state WCTU in 1889 and formed \xe2\x80\x9cWCTU No. 2.\xe2\x80\x9d They intentionally \xe2\x80\x9cavoided using the word colored\xe2\x80\x9d in their name because they \xe2\x80\x9cbelieve[d] all men [were] equal.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en29" href="part0020.html#ch02en29e">29</a></span> The No. 2 held their own statewide conventions and reported directly to the national WCTU as an equal of the white state group.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en30" href="part0020.html#ch02en30e">30</a></span> Racial uplift and equality, more than unity with whites on prohibition, guided Black women on prohibition in the 1880s South.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">As with male drys in other southern states, most dry men in Tennessee affirmed patriarchal politics and distanced themselves from claims that they supported votes for women. Wet papers called the WCTU a \xe2\x80\x9cgreat moral fraud,\xe2\x80\x9d claimed that its members were \xe2\x80\x9ccoquetting with politicians,\xe2\x80\x9d and warned that drys sought women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage. One dry Tennessee newspaper responded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe women of Tennessee have no desire whatever to vote, and female suffrage has no place in the wishes of the prohibitionist of Tennessee.\xe2\x80\x9d Since prohibition was \xe2\x80\x9cpurely and simply a fight of the home against the saloon,\xe2\x80\x9d it was \xe2\x80\x9cperfectly natural that the sympathies of every good woman in Tennessee should be for prohibition, and that they should use their united influence for its success.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en31" href="part0020.html#ch02en31e">31</a></span> For white dry southern men in the 1880s, the association of prohibition with women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage was a political embarrassment, and they sought to distance themselves from women\xe2\x80\x99s political empowerment.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Nonetheless, branches of the \xe2\x80\x9cradical\xe2\x80\x9d WCTU under Frances Willard spread throughout the region after her 1881 tour of the South. Local WCTU unions arose in every southern state by 1883, while state unions took shape in Tennessee in 1881; in Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Texas, 1883; and in Alabama by 1884. These organizations addressed issues from \xe2\x80\x9ctemperance Bible reading\xe2\x80\x9d to work with the press and \xe2\x80\x9cwork among the colored people.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en32" href="part0020.html#ch02en32e">32</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Even more than lobbying for prohibition, the WCTU enjoyed some of its greatest impact through the indoctrination of children in churches and schools. Temperance discourses in the nineteenth century had proclaimed that alcohol abstinence was needed \xe2\x80\x9cto save the youth of our land from falling into the cruel bondage of strong drink,\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en33" href="part0020.html#ch02en33e">33</a></span> and the temperance movement had advanced this kind of education through sermons, books, and lesson plans from the 1840s to the 1920s.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en34" href="part0020.html#ch02en34e">34</a></span> The WCTU not only produced a flood of their own instructional material from the 1870s on but also pressured groups such as the International Sunday School Committee (ISSC), which was initially indifferent to their cause in 1881, to adopt it by 1887.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The Alabama state WCTU demonstrated how southern women could influence male-led denominations to join their cause. In 1885, the Alabama Baptist State Convention, with its 8,927 students in 249 Sunday school classes, endorsed the WCTU\xe2\x80\x99s plan for quarterly temperance lessons. Two years later, WCTU lessons appeared regularly in Southern Baptist periodicals around the nation. While the northern-based Methodist Episcopal Church (MEC) had embraced temperance lessons in 1880, Southern Methodists (MECS) from the North Alabama Conference in 1885 warmly received the WCTU missives and pledged to \xe2\x80\x9cteach temperance from the pulpit, in the Sunday-school, and from house to house until public opinion is properly educated.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en35" href="part0020.html#ch02en35e">35</a></span> Building on such pressure from states across the South, the MECS as a whole took a similar tack in 1886, and quarterly publications of the MECS included those lessons by 1887.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Presbyterians in Alabama proved more difficult to persuade. They took no direct action in 1885 on the WCTU\xe2\x80\x99s pleas, and Presbyterian promises in 1886 to produce explicit temperance lessons in denominational publications did not materialize until 1893. This delay came in part because Presbyterians sought to distance themselves from Methodists and Baptists, who retained fewer connections to Christian tradition than the old-fashioned Reformed faith of Presbyterians. They did, however, follow the ISSC\xe2\x80\x99s materials for Sunday school, so they effectively deployed some temperance education starting in 1887. In addition, the state WCTU worked with groups such as the Loyal Temperance Legions, Bands of Hope, and Kindergarten Schools to reach children beyond the church walls.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en36" href="part0020.html#ch02en36e">36</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Perhaps the most important area of the WCTU\xe2\x80\x99s reach was educating children in public schools. Mary Hanchett Hunt, who headed the WCTU\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Scientific Instruction, led the national effort to indoctrinate children in public education against alcohol by lobbying state legislatures to require anti-alcohol instruction. Hunt\xe2\x80\x99s moral crusade reaped remarkable dividends. By the 1880s, most states in the nation had compulsory temperance education, and by 1901 every state had it three times a week, indoctrinating twenty-two million children. Yet this battle was fought and won state by state at different rates. The Alabama WCTU, for instance, petitioned the state legislature for seven years, from 1884 to 1891, before it relented and required \xe2\x80\x9cinstruction on the evil effects of alcohol on the body and mind.\xe2\x80\x9d By 1908, nearly 259,000 white children and more than 127,000 Black children were being taught the horrors of alcohol in state-run schools.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en37" href="part0020.html#ch02en37e">37</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Hunt\xe2\x80\x99s curricula for students included abundant anti-alcohol material, some of it factually inaccurate and calculated to terrify children.

Yet Atlanta went through a pair of referenda in 1885 and 1887 that turned the city dry for a spell and then returned it wet.

In 1879, the Good Templars there moved the Southern Methodists to pass a resolution urging a state law banning liquor, and the state\xe2\x80\x99s Southern Baptists pushed for a similar measure the next year. Due to a recent tax cut for alcohol sellers, prohibition sentiment was on the upswing in the state. North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic Party had enough drys in the state legislature in early 1881 to push for a statewide vote on banning alcohol by law. The vote took place on August 4, turning the summer into an all-out contest about booze.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en41" href="part0020.html#ch02en41e">41</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The question cut against the grain of party lines, and Democrats were the most divided. The state\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic governor, Thomas Jordan Jarvis, expressed support for prohibition while denouncing any effort to divide white Democratic rule. As a speaker at the North Carolina State Prohibition Convention in May 1881, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf this movement means to organize a political party, I do not go with it, but if it means to do the good work of eradicating vice, I go with it heart and soul.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en42" href="part0020.html#ch02en42e">42</a></span> Soon after the election, a South Carolina newspaper claimed that \xe2\x80\x9cdecent government\xe2\x80\x9d depended on \xe2\x80\x9ckeeping the whites solidly united\xe2\x80\x9d for the Democrats, but prohibition divided whites and strengthened the position of Blacks, who would elect legislators bringing \xe2\x80\x9cshame and disgrace\xe2\x80\x9d to the region.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en43" href="part0020.html#ch02en43e">43</a></span> One paper noted in May that the impending vote in North Carolina was \xe2\x80\x9ctearing both political parties in twain.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en44" href="part0020.html#ch02en44e">44</a></span> The prohibition question threatened politics as usual in the South.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">At first, it seemed that North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s Black vote would rally around prohibition in 1881, but by the election they went overwhelmingly wet. On June 25, a local paper noted: \xe2\x80\x9cEvery colored newspaper in North Carolina\xe2\x80\x9d save one \xe2\x80\x9cfavors prohibition. Is not this significant?\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en45" href="part0020.html#ch02en45e">45</a></span> This perspective was echoed by historian Glenda Elizabeth Gilmore, who stated that the Black press gave \xe2\x80\x9cnearly unanimous endorsement of prohibition.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en46" href="part0020.html#ch02en46e">46</a></span> By July, however, after the State Republican Committee declared itself against prohibition, both Black and white rank and file fell in for party unity. John Campbell Dancy, a Black politician, newspaperman, and popular temperance advocate from Tarboro, North Carolina, refused to campaign for the prohibition bill because \xe2\x80\x9ca very large majority\xe2\x80\x9d of his fellow Republicans were wet, and \xe2\x80\x9cunder no circumstances would he fight the authorities of his party.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en47" href="part0020.html#ch02en47e">47</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Mr. Israel Braddock Abbott, a newspaper editor in New Bern and a former member of the state house, echoed Dancy. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a prohibitionist . . . yet I am a Republican, and stand, first by my party, then secondly by prohibition.\xe2\x80\x9d Since the State Republican Committee opposed the bill, Abbott committed to using \xe2\x80\x9call my influence against the prohibition bill\xe2\x80\x9d and believed that he and every other \xe2\x80\x9ctrue Republican\xe2\x80\x9d would always stand by the party \xe2\x80\x9cunder any and all circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d The same newspaper reporting their views observed that, just weeks earlier, placards advertising dry events \xe2\x80\x9cwere out in full blast\xe2\x80\x94but at this writing we cannot hear of a single Prohibition speaker save Rev.

Given the about-face of Black voters on prohibition, the only notable partisan divide by the August election was between white Democrats.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en48" href="part0020.html#ch02en48e">48</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s 1881 election produced a landslide for the wets. While initial reports varied on the margin of victory, the final total was 166,325 wet to 48,370 dry for a margin of 117,955 votes of nearly 215,000 cast, or more than three-to-one for the wets.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en49" href="part0020.html#ch02en49e">49</a></span> How did the votes break down by party and race? According to the 1880 census, North Carolina had 807,242 white and 581,277 \xe2\x80\x9ccolored\xe2\x80\x9d residents. Despite the minority position of the Republican Party since Reconstruction\xe2\x80\x99s end, tens of thousands of Black citizens there could still cast ballots in 1881.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en50" href="part0020.html#ch02en50e">50</a></span> One white-run South Carolina paper reported that white voters were divided while \xe2\x80\x9cthe negroes were solid against\xe2\x80\x9d prohibition. While the paper also promoted Democratic rule against the \xe2\x80\x9cradicalism\xe2\x80\x9d of racial equality, its reporting on the united Black vote matched other sources such as the <span class="italic">New York Times,</span> which reported that virtually all Republicans, regardless of race, voted wet.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en51" href="part0020.html#ch02en51e">51</a></span> As historian Daniel Jay Whitener put it in the 1940s, \xe2\x80\x9cThe consensus of opinion was that the Negroes voted almost solidly against prohibition.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en52" href="part0020.html#ch02en52e">52</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Most white Democrats also apparently voted against the measure. While one newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s claim that more than two-thirds of Democrats voted wet seems exaggerated, white Democrats almost certainly made up the majority of votes cast, and the vote was more than 77 percent wet, meaning that a strong Democratic majority was nearly certain.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en53" href="part0020.html#ch02en53e">53</a></span> Even without help from solidly wet Republicans, wets would have easily carried the day with Democratic support alone.

Outside the South, Republicans\xe2\x80\x94from leadership to the rank and file\xe2\x80\x94championed prohibition, and the Prohibition Party was more likely to siphon votes from the GOP. After all, the infamous jibe that Democrats were the party of \xe2\x80\x9cRum, Romanism, and Rebellion\xe2\x80\x9d came from a New York Republican in 1884. However, partisan loyalties on alcohol flipped in the South. In 1881 North Carolina, a Missouri paper noted that the \xe2\x80\x9ccurious thing about this Southern prohibition\xe2\x80\x9d is that it appeared to be \xe2\x80\x9caltogether a Democratic idea.\xe2\x80\x9d Democrats were divided on the issue while Republicans\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnearly all of them, white and black\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94opposed it, and the Prohibition Party chiefly threatened Democrats rather than Republicans.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en55" href="part0020.html#ch02en55e">55</a></span> At least in 1881 in the South, rum and Republicanism were allies.</p>\n<p class="x-b">ATLANTA, 1885 AND 1887</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Four years later in neighboring Georgia, however, a coalition cut across partisan and race lines to enact prohibition in Atlanta, one of the South\xe2\x80\x99s largest cities. On November 24, 1885, Henry McNeal Turner, the AME\xe2\x80\x99s most prominent bishop, addressed a crowd of more than five thousand prohibitionists. Most of them, like Turner, were African Americans preparing to vote the next day on banning saloons in the city. In that election, Turner proclaimed, Black Americans were \xe2\x80\x9con trial before the country to see whether they will vote as honest, sober men or whether they can be purchased with money and mean liquor.\xe2\x80\x9d Rather than submit to the chains of corruption by white saloon men, Turner urged them to vote dry so that \xe2\x80\x9cif Abraham Lincoln looked down from heaven[,] he would not be ashamed of the people whom he set free.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en56" href="part0020.html#ch02en56e">56</a></span> The crowd went wild. The next day, Turner\xe2\x80\x99s version of Lincoln would have been proud: the final vote gave drys a margin of victory of just 229 votes out of 7,429 cast.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en57" href="part0020.html#ch02en57e">57</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">For the first time since the end of Reconstruction, freely cast Black votes in Atlanta determined the margin of victory for a major policy issue. That election was, to borrow the title of H. Paul Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s book, \xe2\x80\x9ca stirring and most significant episode\xe2\x80\x9d in race relations in the South. Unlike in North Carolina in 1881, white votes were evenly divided on the issue. Similar municipal prohibition votes, which divided white Democrats and allowed African Americans to cast decisive votes, appeared throughout the South in the 1880s, including in Greenville, South Carolina.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en58" href="part0020.html#ch02en58e">58</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">After African Americans in neighboring North Carolina voted overwhelmingly wet in 1881, why did most Black voters in Atlanta four years later support prohibition? The simplest answer is that Black voters believed that voting dry would better benefit their race. Bishop Turner pointed out in his speech that a vote for prohibition was a vote for Black manhood, proving in the sight of God and man that African American voters were pure and upright, fully deserving human and civil rights alongside the \xe2\x80\x9cbetter sort\xe2\x80\x9d of whites.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">After the vote, it took time for prohibition to take effect, and its results were disappointing for Black voters hoping for visible racial uplift. June 1, 1886, marked the official start of prohibition in Atlanta, though enforcement of the law proved more difficult than voting for it. Despite the promise of great change, prohibition resulted in remarkably little change to the status quo. While white drys valued Black votes, they were more intent on keeping whites in power than advancing prohibition. This sense of betrayal led many African Americans to take a disillusioned attitude toward prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s promises of interracial cooperation. By 1887, a campaign to repeal prohibition took place, and this time wets prevailed, 5,183 votes to 4,061 for the drys. The results of the 1887 vote revealed that Black voters once again decided the election, though this time they went wet.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en59" href="part0020.html#ch02en59e">59</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-b">TEXAS, 1887</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Fulton County\xe2\x80\x99s temporary dry victory by a multiracial coalition in November 1885 inspired similar campaigns for statewide prohibition from neighboring Tennessee to faraway Texas. Not content to stay in Atlanta, Turner also campaigned in Texas and Tennessee in 1887 to spread the dry gospel. Along with many other Black drys, Turner urged the \xe2\x80\x9cbest people\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94namely, those who embraced middle-class Victorian morality, including prohibition\xe2\x80\x94to unite across the race line. Even without John Rayner\xe2\x80\x99s letter encouraging Carroll to invite Turner to Texas for the prohibition campaign, Bishop Turner likely would have come there anyway to support racial uplift by aligning Black citizenship rights with prominent white prohibitionists.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">In Texas, Baptists played major roles for prohibition. Dry leaders in 1886 appointed white Baptist minister James Cranfill to their committee on Texas Baptists. Most importantly, the Baptist preacher and former Confederate soldier B. H. Carroll became head of the drys in 1887.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en60" href="part0020.html#ch02en60e">60</a></span> With Carroll\xe2\x80\x99s blessing, Rayner enlisted African American Baptists for the prohibition cause.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en61" href="part0020.html#ch02en61e">61</a></span> Prominent African American pastors, including the national leader of the AME, Bishop Henry M. Turner of Georgia, campaigned in Texas as well. At the same time, Rayner had warned Carroll that many African American Baptist ministers and newspapermen would side with the brewers if not first secured by the drys.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en62" href="part0020.html#ch02en62e">62</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">While some white drys embraced interracial politics, some preferred the politics of racial exclusion. Cranfill, a white Baptist and member of the Prohibition Party, sabotaged Carroll\xe2\x80\x99s inclusive approach with a racist editorial, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Native White Man,\xe2\x80\x9d in his newspaper. The editorial sought to rally \xe2\x80\x9cthe native, white, Anglo-Saxon elements of the South\xe2\x80\x9d for prohibition against the \xe2\x80\x9cbo-dutch,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cnigger,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clow-bred foreigners.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en63" href="part0020.html#ch02en63e">63</a></span> Even after an official apology by Carroll, Cranfill\xe2\x80\x99s rhetoric helped push every ethnic and racial minority into the wet camp.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en64" href="part0020.html#ch02en64e">64</a></span> Interracial bridges were easier to burn than to build.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Perhaps the weightiest voice against prohibition for white southerners was the high priest of the Lost Cause, Jefferson Davis. Texas\xe2\x80\x99s current US senator and former governor, Richard Coke, had served on Davis\xe2\x80\x99s staff during the war and coaxed him to offer his input on the prohibition question in Texas. Davis replied with an open letter. While he admitted that temperance was good and alcoholism a great evil, prohibition tended \xe2\x80\x9cto destroy individual liberty and moral responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d and would effectively \xe2\x80\x9ceradicate one evil by the substitution of another,\xe2\x80\x9d which was even \xe2\x80\x9cmore fatal\xe2\x80\x9d than the other.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en65" href="part0020.html#ch02en65e">65</a></span> In short, the cure of prohibition was worse than the disease of drunkenness. The letter dominated news around the state for several days, and all parties believed it played a major role in the amendment\xe2\x80\x99s defeat. A similar letter by Davis spelled the same fate for prohibition in Tennessee. The former president of the late Confederacy was not merely political, but almost a religious leader for many southerners who embraced Lost Cause ideology. For them, Davis was more authoritative on the question than any preacher or politician, no matter how venerable.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en66" href="part0020.html#ch02en66e">66</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Wets deftly appealed to the white majority. The wet state committee\xe2\x80\x99s statement of principles claimed that prohibition was \xe2\x80\x9cat war with the fundamental principles of Anglo-Saxon civilization.\xe2\x80\x9d Wets believed that white male supremacy was threatened by prohibition, and they were not entirely wrong. Not only did some drys promote women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage, but the Prohibition Party threatened white supremacy by dividing white votes and undermining one-party rule.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en67" href="part0020.html#ch02en67e">67</a></span> Wets also attacked drys\xe2\x80\x99 interracial collaboration. In early June, wets obtained and published Rayner\xe2\x80\x99s secret letter to Carroll, claiming that African Americans were the brains behind the drys. One wet editor demanded explanation for the Rayner letter and Bishop Turner\xe2\x80\x99s political activism and denounced Carroll for mixing religion and politics, particularly across the race line.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en68" href="part0020.html#ch02en68e">68</a></span> \xe2\x80\x9cThe success of the [wet] cause has never been doubtful for one moment,\xe2\x80\x9d the Waco <span class="italic">Daily Examiner </span>crowed, \xe2\x80\x9csince Parson Rayner came to Parson Carroll\xe2\x80\x99s help with advice as to how to run the campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en69" href="part0020.html#ch02en69e">69</a></span> Since both Black and white clergy fueled the drys\xe2\x80\x99 grassroots movement, they were susceptible to accusations of uniting church and state as well as undermining white supremacy.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en70" href="part0020.html#ch02en70e">70</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">At the same time, African American speakers effectively mobilized many Black voters for the wets. Black Republicans such as J. C. Akers of McKinney and Melvin Wade stumped East Texas, giving wet speeches and debating drys. A former slave, Wade became a prominent Dallas businessman and led several state Republican conventions. According to him, white drys wanted to \xe2\x80\x9ccurtail your freedom,\xe2\x80\x9d but Blacks voted wet out of their \xe2\x80\x9cpassion for freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d Akers and Wade\xe2\x80\x99s contention that prohibition would further limit their already compressed liberty resonated with African American Republicans who recalled their days in bondage, their losses since Reconstruction, and the importance of liberty in American Christianity.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en71" href="part0020.html#ch02en71e">71</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The connection of liquor with liberty in the 1880s took clearest expression in Robert Reed Church Sr., the South\xe2\x80\x99s first African American millionaire, who began his Memphis career as a saloon owner. Like Ida B. Wells, Church was born in Holly Spring, Mississippi, to a slave mother. Church, however, was raised by his white father, owner of a steamboat fleet on the Mississippi River, where he gained entrepreneurial experience. By 1865, he had settled in Memphis and acquired a saloon while his wife, Louisa Ayres Church, opened beauty parlors. A white mob shot Church and left him for dead during the 1866 Memphis riot, but he survived and was determined to remain. During the 1878 yellow fever epidemic, when so many fled Memphis that the city was demoted to a taxing district, he stayed and was the first person to buy a $1,000 bond to help restore the city\xe2\x80\x99s charter. By 1887, Church had established himself as a philanthropist of stature in the city, and by the end of the century, he owned numerous saloons. While Church made most of his fortune in banking and real estate, his continuing connections to saloons linked beer with Black entrepreneurship, resilience, and racial uplift and doubtless inspired many African Americans to vote wet in 1887.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en72" href="part0020.html#ch02en72e">72</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Black activists, both wet and dry, used prohibition referenda as opportunities to divide the white Democratic vote and give Black voters a meaningful role in major political campaigns, especially at the state level. Norris Wright Cuney, the African American leader of Texas Republicans from 1884 to 1896, was offered a seat on Texas\xe2\x80\x99s anti-prohibition executive committee in 1887, but he declined the honor to avoid pushing Democrats into the dry camp. As he put it, he sought to avoid \xe2\x80\x9cgiving the anti-prohibition movement political recognition and sanction, which has been so far avoided on both sides.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet his personal stance on alcohol was not ambiguous. He drank claret each night before sleeping, and the invitation to join the wets showed his equally unambiguous public stance. Ever the politician, Cuney was shrewd enough to realize that his presence on the wet executive committee would likely push more racist whites into the dry camp and so be counterproductive.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en73" href="part0020.html#ch02en73e">73</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Texas wets issued a twenty-six-page pamphlet that advanced two old Christian ideas: limited government and temperance as moderate use rather than outright prohibition. First, it extolled a license system at the local level as the most effective way to limit drunkenness, particularly by encouraging lighter drinks such as beer and light wine against distilled liquors. Second, it denounced prohibition as counterproductive because the impulse to drink was natural and healthy, and any attempt to ban such drinks would only encourage citizens to subvert the law and overdrink. The pamphlet also cited authorities from James Madison to Alexander Hamilton and linked prohibition to then-radical movements like free love and women\xe2\x80\x99s rights.

The election on August 4, 1887, delivered a predictable result: 220,627 wet votes to 129,270 dry. That was a margin of more than 90,000 wet votes, or more than 63 percent of the vote going wet, nearly two to one.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en75" href="part0020.html#ch02en75e">75</a></span> While their victory was not as dramatic as in North Carolina six years earlier, wets demonstrated that they could still dominate the vote in the South. Yet another statewide prohibition election in the South was just a few months away in Tennessee.</p>\n<p class="x-b">TENNESSEE, 1887</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">After their failure in Texas, southern drys in 1887 tried their luck once more in a push for statewide prohibition in Tennessee, which had been growing in dry strength for years. Though the governor vetoed an 1873 law to allow local option elections on prohibition, the Volunteer State a few years later gained the Four Mile Law, perhaps the most advanced temperance legislation in the South. Sewanee, the University of the South, secured in 1877 passage of the Four Mile Law, which banned liquor sales within four miles of a school in an incorporated town. Four years later, the state supreme court ruled that the Four Mile Law could only be enforced around incorporated schools, not in the free schools of some counties. The founding of a state WCTU in 1882 signaled the growth of the dry movement in the state. By 1885, the state WCTU and other drys lobbied the Tennessee legislature to pass a prohibition amendment to the state constitution. The text of the amendment read: \xe2\x80\x9cNo person shall manufacture for sale or keep for sale as a beverage any intoxicating liquors whatever, including wine, ale, and beer. The General Assembly shall by law prescribe regulations for the enforcement of Prohibition herein contained, and shall thereby provide suitable penalties for the violation of the provision thereof.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en76" href="part0020.html#ch02en76e">76</a></span> While a majority of the legislature voted for the amendment, the needed two-thirds majority could not be attained in the senate, and as in North Carolina in 1881, both parties in Tennessee preferred a plebiscite to avoid open division in their ranks. So, on September 29, 1886, an overwhelming majority voted to submit the amendment to a popular vote, which was scheduled to take place exactly a year later, on September 29, 1887.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en77" href="part0020.html#ch02en77e">77</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">As in Georgia and Texas, Tennessee drys also attempted to distance their movement from partisan politics. One paper stated in early September that the prohibition movement \xe2\x80\x9cis not political party measure, and has not connection with any political party,\xe2\x80\x9d despite the attempts of wet papers such as <span class="italic">New Era</span> to brand it as such.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en78" href="part0020.html#ch02en78e">78</a></span> Later that month, the same paper claimed that prohibition sentiment rang throughout the state, endorsed by \xe2\x80\x9cDemocrats and Republicans, black and white\xe2\x80\x9d alike.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en79" href="part0020.html#ch02en79e">79</a></span> Drys claimed then, as they had for years before and decades since, that prohibition would conserve public resources by reducing the crime caused by saloons, which cost taxpayers more through prisons than it gained by liquor licenses. In 1887, drys convinced four hundred convicts in Nashville to claim that three-quarters of the state\xe2\x80\x99s criminals were incarcerated due to alcohol. Newspapers such as the limited-time <span class="italic">Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Appeal</span> and the popular Nashville <span class="italic">Banner</span> supported the dry cause. The Jonesboro WCTU sought to woo voters through music, festive decorations, and \xe2\x80\x9cfree lunches on election day\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a transparent, if effective, effort at low-key bribery in an age before the secret ballot.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en80" href="part0020.html#ch02en80e">80</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Leading up to the vote, tensions rose and occasionally flared into violence. After drys insulted Betsy Ward, a saloon owner who stood fast against a Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Crusade in Greeneville, Tennessee, in 1874, her eighteen-year-old son, William Ward, fought with them, resulting in his death. Despite the drys\xe2\x80\x99 claims that alcohol led to violence and crime, they themselves contributed to the same in the killing of a teenage boy. Wets, for their part, maintained that prohibition would generate more crime by creating an illicit alcohol traffic, harm the economy, reduce public revenue, and undermine the basic principles of democratic liberty.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en81" href="part0020.html#ch02en81e">81</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The vote was closer in Tennessee than in Texas, but it still resulted in defeat for the drys. The tally had 145,197 wet votes to 117,504 dry, or 55 percent wet. According to the <span class="italic">New York Times,</span> it was the largest turnout of any election in the state\xe2\x80\x99s history up to that point.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en82" href="part0020.html#ch02en82e">82</a></span> Despite losing the state, the drys carried several counties in East Tennessee, showing their strength in the Appalachian region.

This charge was the least credible in North Carolina, in which most African Americans followed Republican Party directives and voted wet. Yet even so, the final tally was 77.5 percent wet, so overwhelming that most white voters, Republican and Democratic alike, also likely rejected prohibition. Nevertheless, some white drys implausibly tried to blame African Americans for their loss.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en84" href="part0020.html#ch02en84e">84</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">In Atlanta, on the other hand, it was certainly true that Black votes made up the margin of victory in both directions. As H. Paul Thompson has examined at length, African Americans cast deciding votes to turn the county dry in 1885 as well as to turn it wet in 1887. Black voters who supported prohibition in 1885 because of the opportunity for interracial political cooperation grew disillusioned by the broken promises of whites. At the same time, the white vote also went wet in 1887, meaning both racial groups were equally responsible for the result.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en85" href="part0020.html#ch02en85e">85</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">More ambiguous are the cases of Texas, which voted 63 percent wet, and Tennessee, which went 55 percent wet. Blaming Blacks for their defeat in 1887 had become a popular myth among white drys by the 1900s, as a letter B. H. Carroll in 1909 attests.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en86" href="part0020.html#ch02en86e">86</a></span> Yet whites at the time also baselessly blamed African Americans for prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s failure in the 1880s South, as W. E. B. Du Bois pointed out.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Du Bois, the first African American to earn a PhD from Harvard University, and a self-proclaimed prohibitionist, attested that most white drys immediately scapegoated African Americans for their 1887 defeats. In a seven-page handwritten \xe2\x80\x9cOpen letter to the Southern People\xe2\x80\x9d dated that year, he flipped white drys\xe2\x80\x99 anti-Black narrative and blamed the losses on white folly. He noted that white drys only courted Black voters, whom they ordinarily regarded as animals, because they \xe2\x80\x9csaw that without the Negro vote prohibition would fail.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en87" href="part0020.html#ch02en87e">87</a></span> So, even though the Black man was \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally recognized as a man\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccordially\xe2\x80\x9d entreated by white drys during the campaign, the appeal was \xe2\x80\x9cwholly without effect.\xe2\x80\x9d True, some joined the drys\xe2\x80\x99 ranks: \xe2\x80\x9cThe large majority of intelligent Colored men, the students of Fisk, Atlanta, Clark, and other schools, responded to the call and worked mostly for the cause.\xe2\x80\x9d Nevertheless, \xe2\x80\x9cthe wet majority of the Negro race . . . are <span class="italic">not</span> intelligent\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis original), and so vulnerable to manipulation by wet operatives due to white leaders\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cshort-sighted policy which refused us [African Americans] education and oppressed us with caste prejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en88" href="part0020.html#ch02en88e">88</a></span> In Du Bois\xe2\x80\x99s estimation, the Talented Tenth worked with the \xe2\x80\x9cbetter\xe2\x80\x9d sort of white prohibitionists, while the uneducated masses were seduced by ignoble wet operatives. Thus, southern whites\xe2\x80\x99 racist policies \xe2\x80\x9crecoiled upon its strongest advocates.\xe2\x80\x9d Du Bois took the opportunity to echo the Bible and compare Black voters to Jesus: \xe2\x80\x9cThe stone which the builders rejected had of length become the head of the corner.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en89" href="part0020.html#ch02en89e">89</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Another reason for African American hesitation to vote dry, according to Du Bois, was the close association of white-supremacist Democrats with the dry cause. As he put it, Black voters \xe2\x80\x9csaw, as an old Negro said to me, \xe2\x80\x98A heap too many dimocrats in dis yere ding!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en90" href="part0020.html#ch02en90e">90</a></span> While a few elite African Americans coordinated their dry campaigning with B.

A careful analysis of his raw data and other census information (<span>see <a class="nounder" href="part0012.html#tab02">table 2</a></span>) suggests that Black voters in 1887 did not behave significantly differently from other voters, since there was no consistent correlation between the Black percentage of a county\xe2\x80\x99s population and the percentage of wet voters in that county.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en96" href="part0020.html#ch02en96e">96</a></span></p>\n<p class="table-title" id="tab02"><b class="calibre2">Table 2.</b> Comparing 1887 Texas Vote to Black Population in Select Counties</p>\n<p class="images"><img src="../images/00006.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre3"/></p>\n<p class="table-source"><span class="italic">Source:</span> Sutton, \xe2\x80\x9cEthnic Minorities,\xe2\x80\x9d 35, 80, 82, 86.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">James Ivy has made the most thorough attempt to provide specific numbers for racial and ethnic groups in the 1887 election, and his numbers on African American voters deserve the most scrutiny.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en97" href="part0020.html#ch02en97e">97</a></span> Ivy tallied the Black vote total at 71,338 while placing their opposition to prohibition at over 83 percent, an even higher rate than in Cantrell\xe2\x80\x99s model, which had 74 percent voting wet. Even so, Ivy has confessed that his model is imperfect. To his great credit, Ivy granted that his model initially inaccurately calculated the foreign-born vote and \xe2\x80\x9cyielded an impossible result\xe2\x80\x9d of 122.3 percent wet, which he adjusted accordingly (to 91.3 percent wet, close to Cantrell\xe2\x80\x99s projection of effectively 100 percent wet). In addition, Ivy\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of the Black vote is suspect because of a sizable computational error elsewhere. His vote total for drys in the 1911 statewide vote inverted two crucial numerals: the actual number was 231,096 for Prohibition, but Ivy inverted the 3 and 1 to make 213,096, a difference of 18,000 votes. While understandable, that computational error nearly quadrupled the margin of victory from the actual 1.3 percent of the total vote to \xe2\x80\x9cover five percent\xe2\x80\x9d in his reckoning.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en98" href="part0020.html#ch02en98e">98</a></span> Given the admitted flaws of Ivy\xe2\x80\x99s model regarding foreign-born voters and his erroneous reporting of the 1911 results, it seems possible that his African American vote projection might also need correction.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">If Ivy\xe2\x80\x99s Black vote projection is adjusted to reflect a contemporary estimate of the Black vote, Black voters were <span class="italic">drier</span> than the population at large. By lowering Ivy\xe2\x80\x99s African American wet vote percentage downward by the same proportion as his adjustment for foreign-born whites (about one-quarter), results come to about 62 percent of African Americans voting wet. That number very nearly fits the 60 percent figure given by the <span class="italic">Star of Zion,</span> an African Methodist Episcopal Zion (AMEZ) newspaper edited by John C. Dancy, just a few weeks after the 1887 election. The AMEZ paper conceded that, out of approximately 80,000 African Americans casting ballots in Texas, 60 percent of them voted wet.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en99" href="part0020.html#ch02en99e">99</a></span> While the dry paper might have overestimated dry support, its contemporary reporting and its willingness to give the wets a clear majority of the Black vote support its veracity. Tweaking that 60 percent number upward to account for bias and too-neat rounding, one arrives at something close to the 62 percent made by adjusting Ivy\xe2\x80\x99s total downward. Given that tweaked percentage, African Americans in 1887 Texas voted comparably to white voters. Contrary to scholarly assumptions that Black voters were wetter than whites, they were, at least in Texas, as dry if not <span class="italic">drier</span> than whites.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">However, even if Ivy\xe2\x80\x99s high-end estimate of Black voters as 83 percent wet (or Cantrell\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of 74 percent wet) is correct, native-born white voters would have defeated prohibition all by themselves without help from racial and ethnic minorities. Ivy argues that native-born whites voted 55 percent wet and provided nearly two-thirds of the overall wet vote, while African Americans provided scarcely a quarter of the wet vote. Ivy\xe2\x80\x99s analysis thus effectively refutes Gregg Cantrell\xe2\x80\x99s deductions that native-born whites were evenly split in 1887; Ivy\xe2\x80\x99s 55\xe2\x80\x9345 is a far cry from Cantrell\xe2\x80\x99s 50\xe2\x80\x9350. And if the adjusted projections of the Black vote as 62 percent wet are correct, then even more than 55 percent of native whites voted wet, making the nonwhite vote even less consequential in the wets\xe2\x80\x99 victory. Despite fears among some whites in both the dry and the wet camps that Black participation in the election might imperil white supremacy, African Americans did not cast decisive votes in Texas in 1887.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en100" href="part0020.html#ch02en100e">100</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Given this context, claims by Du Bois and others that Black voters tipped Tennessee wet later that year must be taken with a grain of salt. According to a Tennessee paper (citing a Republican paper elsewhere), more than two-thirds of whites voted dry while about 92 percent of black voters went wet, so that drys would have won by 40,000 votes were it not for Black voters. However, the paper defended the integrity of African Americans; they were not \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly influenced\xe2\x80\x9d but voted wet because \xe2\x80\x9cthey are not far enough away from the period of slavery to willingly take any risks where a question of individual liberty is in the remotest degree involved.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed, black voters were even <span class="italic">more</span> wary than whites of any movement that might seem to be \xe2\x80\x9cabridging their rights,\xe2\x80\x9d including prohibition. Black voters in Tennessee went wetter than whites, the paper claimed, because their love of liberty was greater.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en101" href="part0020.html#ch02en101e">101</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Despite its charitable interpretation of why most Black voters went wet, this paper\xe2\x80\x99s claim that 92 percent of them opposed prohibition seems a bit high, particularly given the much more mixed African American vote in Texas earlier that year (62 percent wet). While African Americans might have provided the margin of victory in Tennessee, this seems implausible. The failure of Tennessee to produce effective statewide prohibition for several more decades, years after most Black voters had been effectively disfranchised, suggests that most whites had opposed prohibition since the 1880s and continued to do so for decades. A simpler and more plausible explanation is that white and Black votes in Tennessee both voted equally wet, but white drys sought to blame their failure on their Black neighbors\xe2\x80\x94and wet Republicans sought to credit Black voters for their defense of liberty.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Rather than being caused by Black voters, the defeat of southern drys in the 1880s statewide votes was mainly due to white evangelical ministers failing to convince their parishioners. Methodist and Baptist laity were ambivalent about political preaching; the flocks had flogged back their shepherds. This pew-pulpit divide was laid bare in the title of the 1887 Baptist General Convention of Texas (BGCT) temperance report: \xe2\x80\x9cAttitude which Baptists <span class="italic">should</span> Occupy toward the Liquor Traffic\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis mine).

Women helped stir up the first major surge of interest for prohibition in the 1880s, though most southern white men wanted to keep women out of politics just as much as they wanted to keep out prohibition. As James Ivy argues, the close association of prohibition with socially disruptive \xe2\x80\x9clong-haired men\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cshort-haired women\xe2\x80\x9d contributed to the defeat of prohibition in Texas in 1887, and dry leaders thereafter marginalized the role of women in future prohibition campaigns. Similar results in North Carolina and Tennessee that decade reinforced similar ideas across the region. Joe Coker argues that prohibitionists across the South gained success only because they adapted to uphold traditional gender roles, keeping women on a pedestal but away from the ballot box.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en110" href="part0020.html#ch02en110e">110</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">While the 1887 campaigns failed by wide margins, they mobilized the Black vote and demonstrated that African Americans were sought after as a swing vote in elections on alcohol. Unfortunately, many white drys perceived the Black vote as a stumbling block to be overcome and sought to strengthen their position by joining a growing movement to disfranchise nonwhites. The 1880s campaigns thus generated a backlash that would eventually link prohibition in the South inextricably with Jim Crow.</p>\n</body></html>\n'</p>

He moved to Kentucky in 1785 or 1786 and gained a reputation as a greater preacher than his brothers Joseph and Lewis, who were also Baptist pioneers there. Elijah\xe2\x80\x99s preaching voice was \xe2\x80\x9clike the loud sound of a sweet trumpet\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9ccommonly brought many tears from the hearers\xe2\x80\x9d and converted many. He was also an entrepreneur: he built Kentucky\xe2\x80\x99s first sawmill, made rope, fulled cloth, and founded a bourbon distillery around 1789. He was known for church controversies and spent most of his money chasing after new business ventures, leaving his family poor when he died in May 1808. Yet the <span class="italic">Kentucky Gazette</span> eulogized him: \xe2\x80\x9cIf virtue consists in being useful to our fellow citizens, perhaps there were few more virtuous men than Mr. Craig.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en2" href="part0020.html#ch01en2e">2</a></span> At least in the early nineteenth century, distilling bourbon was a mark of virtue for a Baptist minister.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Elijah Craig\xe2\x80\x99s story illustrates how some pious southerners in the nineteenth century saw no need to choose between liquor and the Lord. Even strict Baptists tolerated crafting, selling, and drinking high-proof distilled beverages, to say nothing of fermented beverages such as wine and beer with less alcoholic content. Permissive attitudes to intoxicating drinks persisted amid early nineteenth-century revivals, commonly called the Second Great Awakening, and most southerners carried these views with them to the late nineteenth century. This permissive attitude toward alcohol stretched back much further than the colonial era; it continued a millennia-long Judeo-Christian tradition of appreciation for both common and consecrated drinks.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Traditional Christian attitudes towards alcoholic beverages tended to oppose prohibition in four areas. While classical Christian views of temperance meant moderate use, prohibitionists\xe2\x80\x99 insistence on total abstinence from alcohol more closely followed Islamic teaching. Passages of the Bible also supported moderate alcohol use, particularly regarding wine. The celebration of Christian communion had always involved sacred wine until the nineteenth-century innovation of grape juice. And early American views on Christian liberty, particularly in the South, emphasized limited government and anticlerical politics.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Church structure mattered in these debates. Top-down Methodists tended to be more united, better organized, and earlier supporters of prohibition than bottom-up Baptists. Theology also mattered. \xe2\x80\x9cHigh church\xe2\x80\x9d groups such as Catholics, Episcopalians, and Lutherans tended to defer to traditional readings favoring wine in communion and at home, while relatively \xe2\x80\x9clow church\xe2\x80\x9d denominations such as Baptists, Methodists, and Presbyterians were more likely to defy ancient tradition and embrace theological novelties such as prohibition.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The American transformation from traditional views on temperance, the Bible, communion, and liberty to the modern innovation of prohibition was facilitated by a remarkable shift in how American Christians derived their spiritual authority from a common-sense, republican, individualist reading of the Bible. As changing circumstances and modern science revealed new threats from alcohol abuse, many American Christians used Scripture to defend a totalistic rejection of alcoholic drinks. They argued for alcohol abstinence on the grounds of experience, expediency, and proper application of general Christian principles, though even some prohibitionists admitted that the Bible did not forbid drinking as such. Other Christians deployed the Bible to defend a more traditional view that alcohol was not evil but was a gift of God.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Christian Temperance</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Wets claimed that totalistic opposition to alcohol, whether through teetotalism or prohibition, undermined traditional Christian teaching that moderate use promoted morality better than total abstinence. \xe2\x80\x9cTemperance\xe2\x80\x9d had throughout Christian history been understood not as abstinence from alcohol but as the moderate use of pleasure. Only in modern times did temperance take on a connection with alcohol. Following Aristotle\xe2\x80\x99s notion of finding virtue between two extremes, ancient and medieval theologians developed articulations of Christian virtue that rested between the extreme vices of excess and deficiency. For such theologians and philosophers, temperance lay between the excess of self-indulgence, which was common and dangerous, and the deficiency of shunning pleasure, which was so rare in Aristotle\xe2\x80\x99s time that he invented a name for it: \xe2\x80\x9cinsensibility.\xe2\x80\x9d The great medieval Catholic theologian Thomas Aquinas explicitly tackled the issue of whether shunning pleasure could be considered a vice and concluded that abstinence could be praiseworthy or necessary in certain circumstances for the sake of physical or spiritual health, but even so pleasure ought not to be shunned altogether.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en3" href="part0020.html#ch01en3e">3</a></span> Translating the virtue to alcohol use, self-indulgence meant drunkenness, insensibility meant abstinence, and temperance meant moderate drinking.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Given this long-standing understanding of temperance, prohibition would have seemed absurd to Americans before the nineteenth century. Even the exacting Pilgrims and Puritans of seventeenth-century New England had no problem with fermented spirits; the Mayflower was well-stocked with them. The Puritan Francis Higginson sailed for Massachusetts Bay in 1629 with forty-five casks of beer and twenty gallons of brandy for his Puritan relatives and community, and Jonathan Edwards\xe2\x80\x99s father enjoyed an ordination party in 1698 provisioned with four quarts of rum and eight quarts of wine. Increase Mather preached that \xe2\x80\x9cwine is from God\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cthe drunkard is from the Devil.\xe2\x80\x9d Historian Mark Noll notes that some scholars think Increase\xe2\x80\x99s son Cotton Mather coined the phrase, but if so, he was echoing Increase\xe2\x80\x99s words from 1673: \xe2\x80\x9cDrink is in itself a creature from God, and to be received with thankfulness.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en4" href="part0020.html#ch01en4e">4</a></span> Early Americans followed classical Christian theology to argue that alcoholic beverages were God-given, so insisting upon complete abstinence was not virtue but vice.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">If early Puritans in colonial New England could and did distinguish alcohol\xe2\x80\x99s good and evil uses, the denizens of the US South had even fewer qualms about alcohol. Even by the accounts of Ernest Cherrington, a prolific researcher for the Anti-Saloon League, colonial Americans had \xe2\x80\x9cno condemnation of intoxicating liquors as such,\xe2\x80\x9d and even though use of alcoholic drinks \xe2\x80\x9cincreased by leaps and bounds,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cmoral and religious forces\xe2\x80\x9d of the day had \xe2\x80\x9cno attitude of hostility to intoxicants,\xe2\x80\x9d but only against drunkenness.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en5" href="part0020.html#ch01en5e">5</a></span> Indeed, liquors \xe2\x80\x9cin themselves were considered wholesome and necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d and when taken in \xe2\x80\x9cmoderation . . . were considered helpful and stimulating.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en6" href="part0020.html#ch01en6e">6</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">This classical notion of temperance enjoyed widespread acceptance by American Christians until the early nineteenth century, when alcoholism in the United States reached epidemic proportions. Advances in distilling technology, the profitability of converting grain crops into alcoholic beverages, the replacement of milder beverages like beer and cider with stronger drinks like whiskey, and social acceptance of heavier drinking was turning the United States after the Revolution into the \xe2\x80\x9cAlcohol Republic,\xe2\x80\x9d as historian W. J. Rorabaugh put it. By 1830, an average American over fifteen years old drank eighty-eight bottles of whiskey annually, nearly three times the average today. Drinking became synonymous with drunkenness. These excesses prompted reformers like Lyman Beecher to form in 1826 the American Temperance Society (ATS) and to spearhead a national temperance movement against the destructive influences of alcohol. Temperance advocates initially preferred moral suasion to combat the evils of demon rum. The Virginia ATS chapter in 1827, for example, denounced the \xe2\x80\x9cintemperate use of spirituous liquors\xe2\x80\x9d but did not call for total abstinence, much less for prohibition.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en7" href="part0020.html#ch01en7e">7</a></span> Prohibitionists, however, insisted upon wielding the moral force of the state to eliminate the very temptation to drink by outlawing the production and sale of alcohol.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en8" href="part0020.html#ch01en8e">8</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Why did prohibitionists break with Christian tradition by adopting such a radical approach of not only abstinence, but legal prohibition? The answer lies in part in the changes in religious sensibilities between the American Revolution and the Civil War. During that time, most Protestants in the United States increasingly based their faith on individualistic, republican, and common-sense readings of the Bible. This new consensus replaced more traditional Christian views (even among Protestants) that revered community authority, expert exegesis, and hierarchy. Mark Noll, Nathan O. Hatch, and others have observed that this alliance between representative government and Christianity was by no means obvious or natural but was remarkably innovative for a faith that had been defined through hierarchical relationships and community consensus. In short, most American Protestants had already broken dramatically with Christian tradition by aligning it to individualistic common sense, which made it more likely for American Christians to adopt innovations that were unconnected or even opposed to classical Christian teachings, including alcohol abstinence and prohibition.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en9" href="part0020.html#ch01en9e">9</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Various learned laymen across the nation took up the pen to expose prohibition as an innovation that had more to do with legalistic Islam than with classic Christianity. In 1867, John A. Andrew of Boston spoke out at a public forum against \xe2\x80\x9cthose who would rest the hopes of humanity on the commandments of men\xe2\x80\x9d such as prohibition and pointed instead to \xe2\x80\x9cthe promises of Gospel Grace\xe2\x80\x9d as the effective means to live truly temperate lives. He also pointed to the positive reforms of England in that century, citing the people\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c[r]eligious faith, Christian charity, philanthropic benevolence,\xe2\x80\x9d and other virtues in all levels of society, which \xe2\x80\x9cnow battle effectually against the vices of society, and the evil inclinations of human nature.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThis progress,\xe2\x80\x9d he claimed, \xe2\x80\x9cwas not Jewish, nor Mohammedan, but it was Christian. It was not due to law, but to liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d He believed the most effective way of combating vice among all classes was Christian faith and virtue stemming from liberty, not the legalism he saw in other religions.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en10" href="part0020.html#ch01en10e">10</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Some Christians in the South shared this perception. Alexander Watkins Terrell, a Texas state senator who later became a chief architect of the state\xe2\x80\x99s dry poll-tax law, also denounced prohibition in 1879. On the one hand, he claimed that centuries of Islamic prohibition on alcohol led to the gradual \xe2\x80\x9cphysical and moral decay\xe2\x80\x9d of the Turks. On the other hand, he objected to banning wine, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich the Savior himself once made by his miraculous power, to cheer the heart of a bridegroom and his guests, and against the temperate use of which He never uttered a word during all his pilgrimage on earth.\xe2\x80\x9d For Terrell and his constituents, temperate alcohol use was on the side of Jesus and freedom, while prohibitionists were on the side of Muhammad and regression.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en11" href="part0020.html#ch01en11e">11</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-a">The Bible and Booze</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">As Terrell\xe2\x80\x99s reference to Jesus turning water into wine in John 2 indicated, wets could cite the Bible for their cause just as well as, if not better than, their dry opponents. This seems to challenge Mark Noll\xe2\x80\x99s observation that popular recourse to the Bible as authoritative for a major US political crisis occurred for the last time regarding slavery. The dominant approach in that theological and moral debate was a common-sense hermeneutic that valued individuals\xe2\x80\x99 interpretations of the Bible over church tradition and magisterial authority, which left only the violence of the Civil War as a viable option to overcome the impasse over slavery.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en12" href="part0020.html#ch01en12e">12</a></span> Following the conflict, ordinary people in the United States displaced debates over Bible passages from the public discourse because, without recourse to an outside authority like church tradition, it was open to conflicting interpretations and so failed to provide the means to resolve the issue of slavery apart from devastating Civil War.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en13" href="part0020.html#ch01en13e">13</a></span> When it came to prohibition, however, both drys and wets freely wielded the Bible for their cause, suggesting that the Bible still carried weight in the postbellum United States.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The American prohibition movement sprang not from literal interpretations of the Bible but from Americans\xe2\x80\x99 experience. Drinking became a serious problem for many churches around the nation after the Civil War, but most Southern Baptists did not immediately call for prohibition, even if they did recommend abstinence from alcohol. The official newspaper of the Baptist General Association of Virginia recommended in October of 1865 that only teetotalism could prevent drunkenness, but five years later admitted that such behavior was not demanded by the Bible: \xe2\x80\x9cTotal abstinence from intoxicating liquors, with certain limitations, is commended by expediency, the experience of multitudes, the opinion of many wise and good men, and by a fair application of certain scriptural principles.\xe2\x80\x9d Still, they admitted \xe2\x80\x9cthe Bible contains no prohibition of the use of wine and strong drink, and all attempts to draw such a prohibition from it is a perversion of Scripture, and injurious to the cause which it is intended to subserve.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en14" href="part0020.html#ch01en14e">14</a></span> In 1870, Southern Baptists had not yet claimed the Bible directly supported alcohol abstinence, much less prohibition.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Skepticism about the wisdom of using the Bible to insist on abstinence persisted among Southern Baptists until the 1880s. A few voices in major Baptist periodicals argued for moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages, including hard liquor, as late as 1884. After a consensus emerged that distilled liquors were unacceptable drinks for serious Christians, some Baptists continued to suggest that the best antidote for intemperance was moderate consumption of wine, beer, cider, and other malt drinks that occurred naturally and featured less alcoholic content. Even these modest allowances were frequently countered by observations that excessive drinking of any alcoholic beverage could easily lead to drunkenness.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en15" href="part0020.html#ch01en15e">15</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The hardest drink habit for Southern Baptists to kick was wine. Many southerners considered wine the most innocuous of alcoholic beverages. Farm columns in Baptist journals such as the Atlanta <span class="italic">Christian Index</span> included wine recipes and encouragement to produce diversified crops for the manufacture of wines from various fruits, including blackberries, strawberries, and scuppernongs.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en16" href="part0020.html#ch01en16e">16</a></span> Baptist writers also acknowledged that wine was encouraged in the Bible. St. Paul urged his prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 in 1 Timothy 5:23 to \xe2\x80\x9ctake a little wine\xe2\x80\x9d for his health, and Jesus famously turned water into wine in a wedding in John 2. \xe2\x80\x9cWe fully believe,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote one contributor to the Richmond, Virginia, <span class="italic">Religious Herald </span>in 1879, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the wine made by Christ at the marriage in Cana was intoxicating, if drunk to excess.\xe2\x80\x9d Another stated, \xe2\x80\x9cThat Christ drank wine during His stay on earth, no one can doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en17" href="part0020.html#ch01en17e">17</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Nonetheless, many Southern Baptists insisted upon shunning wine despite the examples in the Bible because they interpreted their faith according to a common-sense understanding of their own times. Baptist icon John A. Broadus of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary granted that Jesus used wine in the first century but claimed that Christ only drank it because of cultural custom. Had Jesus lived in the present, Broadus insisted, he would have shunned wine and preferred more respectable drinks like tea or coffee. A Virginian editor in 1888 urged teetotalers: if they would focus on \xe2\x80\x9cpresent facts and present dangers\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cabandon all attempts to find an explicit Bible command, what a relief it would be to them and to the cause!\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en18" href="part0020.html#ch01en18e">18</a></span> By the 1890s, Southern Baptists had hardened their views against alcohol as the greatest vice, though this view sprang from experience rather than the Bible. The Florida Baptist Convention called alcohol the most \xe2\x80\x9cdestructive curse of the 19th century, imperiling our homes, hostile to our churches, a constant menace to society, the prolific mother of vice and crime, the corrupter of politics, a breeder of anarchy in our government, and in all its dark record the offspring of the devil.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en19" href="part0020.html#ch01en19e">19</a></span> For Southern Baptist drys in the late nineteenth century, appeals to common sense and present realities trumped clear biblical examples condoning alcohol consumption.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Methodists banned alcohol consumption before Baptists, though experience and reason had more to do with the proscription than Scripture or tradition. John Wesley established the rule forbidding \xe2\x80\x9cDrunkenness, or drinking spirituous liquors unless in cases of necessity,\xe2\x80\x9d for his followers in the eighteenth century. While British Methodists threatened to ban members for drinking liquor as early as 1795, American Methodists\xe2\x80\x99 book of discipline in use at that time did not mention drinking, though it did banish people who talked before church. By the 1870s, however, the white-led Southern Methodist and Northern Methodist denominations both included the rule against drunkenness and distilled drinks. Even then, \xe2\x80\x9cspiritous liquors\xe2\x80\x9d meant distilled beverages and excluded fermented drinks with lower alcoholic content such as beer and wine.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en20" href="part0020.html#ch01en20e">20</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">In the nineteenth century, white and Black American Methodists began to embrace alcohol abstinence and then prohibition. The African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), the first major Black denomination in the United States, had since the 1830s taught abstinence from all kinds of alcohol and since the 1850s backed prohibition laws to purify society at large.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en21" href="part0020.html#ch01en21e">21</a></span> By 1883, the main white Methodist group, the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (MECS), began treating not only drinking but also the production and sale of alcohol\xe2\x80\x94and soon even renting property to those in the alcohol trade\xe2\x80\x94as an evil worthy of church discipline.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en22" href="part0020.html#ch01en22e">22</a></span> These standards stemmed more from evolving understandings of the dangers of alcohol than the teachings of Scripture.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Dry organizations such as the Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) invoked the Bible freely to support their mission. A typical state-conference report of the Texas WCTU reveals the organization\xe2\x80\x99s heavy use of a common-sense evangelical approach to the Bible not only in rhetoric but in regular functions. The second page provides the \xe2\x80\x9cWCTU Benediction,\xe2\x80\x9d an exact quote of the Aaronic Blessing from Number 6:24\xe2\x80\x9326.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en23" href="part0020.html#ch01en23e">23</a></span> The use of these verses as the WCTU Benediction suggests their ritualistic function in concluding all manner of events by officially invoking God\xe2\x80\x99s presence and aid through the unambiguous use of the Bible as Scripture. The regular function of Scripture for the WCTU is made clear in the yearbook at the end of the report, which included a Bible reading for each week, with the verses taken from books throughout the Bible.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en24" href="part0020.html#ch01en24e">24</a></span> The fourth page of the report lists various \xe2\x80\x9c<span class="small-caps2">MEMORIAL DAYS</span>,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9cFlower Mission Day,\xe2\x80\x9d quoting the uncited Bible verse Leviticus 23:4 as justification: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are Feasts of the Lord, Even holy Convocations, Which ye shall proclaim in their season.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en25" href="part0020.html#ch01en25e">25</a></span> Like the use of the Aaronic Blessing in the benediction, this use of Leviticus lacks any cultural or historical context of the verses composed several millennia earlier yet demonstrates a common-sense evangelical hermeneutic. The women of the WCTU found a way to link their every deed to the Bible. This creative use of the Bible was not merely a pretext but inspiration: God was on their side, and their authority derived from the God of the Bible.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Some Christian drys believed that they had special access to God\xe2\x80\x99s will and ways. Frances E. Willard, who served as the WCTU president for nearly twenty years and grew it to be the largest woman\xe2\x80\x99s organization of the nineteenth century, was a devout evangelical Methodist. She attributed her support for \xe2\x80\x9cHome Protection,\xe2\x80\x9d or women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage, as a means to support prohibition, to a direct revelation from God: \xe2\x80\x9cUpon my knees there was borne in upon my mind from loftier regions, the declaration, you are to speak for the woman\xe2\x80\x99s ballot as a weapon of protection to her home.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en26" href="part0020.html#ch01en26e">26</a></span> For Willard and likeminded evangelical women, God granted them spiritual authority and wisdom to defend their God-given roles as women and mothers through political activism.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en27" href="part0020.html#ch01en27e">27</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The Texas WCTU\xe2\x80\x99s presidential address portrayed their fight as a simple matter of good against evil.

This thesis claimed that the Bible referred two kinds of wine: a nonalcoholic wine for all positive references, and an alcoholic wine for all negative references. Hundreds of educated American clergy around the nation objected to the two-wine thesis in 1888, including the Rev. Edward Hurtt Jewett. Using references to the original Hebrew and Greek texts of the Bible, Jewett argued that \xe2\x80\x9cthe term <span class="italic">unfermented</span> wine, in Scripture phraseology, is a misnomer and self-contradictory,\xe2\x80\x9d since wine was always presumed to have been fermented.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en31" href="part0020.html#ch01en31e">31</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Some years later, Edward R. Emerson, a winemaker, wrote <span class="italic">A Lay Thesis on Bible Wines</span> to echo and expand upon the arguments of Jewett and others. Emerson explained at length why the laws of fermentation, ancient authors, leading lexicons, and the best modern scholars give no support to the two-wine thesis, displaying considerable erudition and mastery of ancient texts, especially for a layperson. His first defense notes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Bible in unmistakable language commended wine,\xe2\x80\x9d yet the innovation of anti-alcohol asceticism produced the two-wine argument.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en32" href="part0020.html#ch01en32e">32</a></span> Emerson claimed that, in making this distinction, \xe2\x80\x9cReason, science, and the teachings of two thousand years were to fall apart as if cut with knives.\xe2\x80\x9d In place of reason and tradition, \xe2\x80\x9cLinguistic legerdemain has been indulged in to such an extent that even many of the most watchful have failed to see the glaring absurdity and utter ridiculousness of the name they have chosen for their wine,\xe2\x80\x9d namely \xe2\x80\x9cunfermented wine.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en33" href="part0020.html#ch01en33e">33</a></span> Drinking fermented wine, Emerson noted, was ubiquitous among the ancient Israelites and their neighboring nations.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en34" href="part0020.html#ch01en34e">34</a></span> He also noted that, throughout the Bible, the typical Hebrew and Greek words for wine (<span class="italic">yayin</span> and <span class="italic">oinos</span>) are always spoken of as \xe2\x80\x9ca blessing sent by God for the use of man\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cto be used in the service of God,\xe2\x80\x9d such as in Isaiah 55:1\xe2\x80\x932, where the word functions \xe2\x80\x9cas a symbol of the highest spiritual blessing.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en35" href="part0020.html#ch01en35e">35</a></span> Other Hebrew and Greek words for wine, such as <span class="italic">\xe2\x80\x99asis</span> (Isaiah 49:26), <span class="italic">tirosh</span> (Hosea 4:11), and <span class="italic">gleukos</span> (Acts 2:13), all imply intoxication, and no word for wine in the Bible ever refers to a nonalcoholic beverage.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en36" href="part0020.html#ch01en36e">36</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Emerson continued his reasoning with reference to many other Bible passages that referred to wine positively.

Emerson and likeminded wets avoided the extreme of prohibition not merely because they professed fidelity to the plain meaning of the text, but because they\xe2\x80\x94unlike prohibitionists\xe2\x80\x94refused to separate Bible interpretation from the church\xe2\x80\x99s tradition and ethics.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Among Southern Baptists, this two-wine argument raged especially between 1887 and 1890 and then abruptly ceased to attract significant debate. This debate on Bible wines either waned in 1890 because prohibitionists had won or, more likely, because Baptists agreed to disagree and focus on more important matters, since the debate over prohibition was not resolved in the SBC until 1896.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en40" href="part0020.html#ch01en40e">40</a></span> Wets like Jewett and Emerson interpreted the Bible through philology and history, yet they also argued from a plain reading of the Bible according to church tradition and common sense. Prohibitionists also appealed to philology and history to reinterpret the Bible, but the argument mattered only because many on both sides viewed the Bible as Scripture.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">However, some nineteenth-century prohibitionists publicly rejected the Bible as Scripture, including Elizabeth Cady Stanton. An early advocate for prohibition, Stanton turned away from evangelical Christianity before reaching adulthood. By the 1890s, Stanton grew convinced that Christianity and the Bible were inimical to gender equality and had to be confronted. She initiated the <span class="italic">Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Bible,</span> a collaborative project in which she and other women offered commentary on Bible passages that dealt directly with women, especially those used by opponents of gender equality. Consequently, she and other religious radicals were marginalized from both the suffrage and temperance movements by the end of the nineteenth century. Nonetheless, the fact that heterodox women such as Stanton had played key roles in the earlier temperance movement suggested their continued presence in the movement in years to come.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en41" href="part0020.html#ch01en41e">41</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Prohibitionists who invoked the Bible differed on how literally to interpret it and on whether prohibition was primarily about saving individual souls or redeeming society. Temperance literature in the nineteenth century often contained variants of, \xe2\x80\x9cNo drunkard . . . shall inherit the kingdom of God,\xe2\x80\x9d from 1 Corinthians 6:10,<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en42" href="part0020.html#ch01en42e">42</a></span> and a few leading drys repeated this claim in the twentieth century. Ferdinand Iglehart dedicated his celebration of prohibition, <span class="italic">King Alcohol Dethroned,</span> to the salvation of souls: \xe2\x80\x9cThis book goes out with the hope that it may reclaim some drunkard . . . that some soul may be saved for time and eternity.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en43" href="part0020.html#ch01en43e">43</a></span> However, this fear of hell was not shared by progressive prohibitionists such as the modernist Presbyterian Charles Stelzle, who took a leading role in the Social Gospel movement to reform society according to Christian principles and modern scientific management. In his defense of dry laws, <span class="italic">Why Prohibition!,</span> Stelzle mocked the idea of people going to hell as something the fundamentalist revivalist \xe2\x80\x9cBilly Sunday says.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en44" href="part0020.html#ch01en44e">44</a></span> Thus, Christian prohibitionists were divided between fundamentalists like Sunday, whose concern to save souls through prohibition was rooted in a common-sense evangelical interpretation of the Bible, and modernists like Stelzle, who mocked their concern and shunned such a literal reading of Scripture.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The Bible could and did play on both sides of the prohibition divide, though some prohibitionists treated it as peripheral or nonessential to their cause while anti-prohibitionists at times invoked the Bible more effectively. Baptists sometimes admitted that one could not reasonably argue for prohibition from the Bible and that Jesus drank and made wine. Only by applying contemporary culture and experiences could Christians conclude that alcohol must be shunned. Christians on both sides often resorted to extra-biblical arguments rather than trusting Scripture alone to resolve the issue. Whether supported by the Bible or not, once prohibitionists viewed alcohol as evil, the struggle expanded beyond prohibition to the question of wine in communion.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Communion Wine</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">On Christmas Day 1838, in the Masonic Lodge of Matagorda, the first Episcopalian Eucharist in the Republic of Texas was celebrated. The priest, Fr.

The Christian tradition of wine in the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Supper derived from the Jewish custom of Seder dinner, with its four cups of wine. Since at least the first century, ancient Christians began meeting together over bread and wine. The tradition gradually transitioned from a \xe2\x80\x9clove feast\xe2\x80\x9d meal to a highly structured ritual in which a priest distributed wafers and sips of wine. For most medieval peasants, communion wine remained in sight but out of reach, reserved for priests. Though greatly changed, two constants remained: bread and wine.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The Reformation democratized the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Supper. The English <span class="italic">Book of Common Prayer</span> made worship more accessible in many ways: services were in the English vernacular, the altar became a table closer to the people, and everyone was encouraged to partake of both bread and wine weekly. Ironically, even as Protestant doctrine made the Eucharist more accessible, Protestant anxiety about taking the Eucharist improperly led to communion becoming less frequent and less important in Protestant worship just as the Council of Trent ordered every faithful Catholic to partake in communion at each mass.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en47" href="part0020.html#ch01en47e">47</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The centuries-old assumptions that communion should feature fermented wine came under attack in innovative America. In 1869, a British-born Wesleyan Methodist named Thomas Bramwell Welch invented a pasteurization method to prevent the fermentation of grape juice. Though other methods previously existed to create nonalcoholic grape juice, and Welch\xe2\x80\x99s own Wesleyan Methodist denomination had explicitly required nonalcoholic wine for communion since 1843, Welch\xe2\x80\x99s method could produce higher-quality juice in larger quantities than other techniques. Welch encouraged churches to use his \xe2\x80\x9cunfermented wine,\xe2\x80\x9d and his sales increased commensurately with the growing popularity of prohibition.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en48" href="part0020.html#ch01en48e">48</a></span> As the nineteenth century closed, more American Christians came to believe that personal experience, common sense, and modern science were incompatible with the doctrine that alcoholic beverages should be used in the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Supper. As Jennifer L. Woodruff Tait<span class="superscript"> </span>argues, the move to replace communion wine with grape juice among Methodists represented \xe2\x80\x9cthe natural result of applying the common-sense worldview to the temperance problem.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en49" href="part0020.html#ch01en49e">49</a></span> Some churches forsook alcohol while others revered it. These divides over alcohol suggested that the historical peculiarities of denominations and theological traditions affected their approach to the issue of communion wine. Since Tait has provided an excellent description of these shifts in Methodist churches, much of the following analysis will focus on a few other Christian groups, starting with Baptists.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Some Baptists preferred to keep alcohol in their sacred wine. From 1886 to 1890, the main argument among Baptists had shifted from whether alcoholic beverages were generally permissible (they were not) to whether they should use wine or grape juice in communion. Though Baptists viewed communion as an ordinance, or command to be followed, rather than a sacrament, or a means of God\xe2\x80\x99s grace, they took ordinances seriously. The very name \xe2\x80\x9cBaptist\xe2\x80\x9d referred to their only other ordinance, baptism, on which they staked their denominational identity. Since Baptists insisted upon the biblical model of baptism\xe2\x80\x94full immersion for believing adults only\xe2\x80\x94how could they justify using anything other than wine for communion? \xe2\x80\x9cIf we must have real water for baptism and not some substitute for it,\xe2\x80\x9d a Baptist from Florida asked, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy not have real wine for the supper?\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en50" href="part0020.html#ch01en50e">50</a></span> Another insisted that replacing communion wine with grape juice was just as absurd as \xe2\x80\x9csubstitut[ing] sprinkling for baptism\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a violation of <span class="italic">the</span> Baptist distinctive.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en51" href="part0020.html#ch01en51e">51</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Ironically, those who contended most firmly for baptism by immersion also tended to be those who insisted upon replacing wine with grape juice. To hold their view with any consistency, prohibitionists who claimed \xe2\x80\x9cliteralist\xe2\x80\x9d views of the Bible fiercely advocated the two-wine thesis. This theory essentially argued that all the Bible\xe2\x80\x99s positive references to wine were to nonalcoholic juice while all the negative references were to alcoholic wine. Wets like Edward R. Emerson claimed that partaking of wine in communion was \xe2\x80\x9cthe most sacred and solemn act that a human being can perform.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en52" href="part0020.html#ch01en52e">52</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Other Baptist drys, less willing to resort to exegetical gymnastics, took a more \xe2\x80\x9cliberal\xe2\x80\x9d view on Bible wines. This camp included John Broadus, who admitted that all wine in the Bible was alcoholic but used reason and experience to conclude that biblical authors and figures indulged only because doing so was necessary in their culture, but they would never have partaken in modern times, when such beverages were linked with vice. For this reason, and because communion was merely symbolic and using wine would cause total abstainers to stumble in their faith, grape juice could and should be substituted for wine in communion.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en53" href="part0020.html#ch01en53e">53</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">After 1890, the argument over communion wine ceased to occupy much attention of most Southern Baptists, who largely agreed to disagree on the matter. A motion to insist on unfermented grape juice in communion at the 1891 convention of Tennessee Baptists was tabled. Various articles in Baptist journals in 1900 likewise failed to evoke responses or rejoinders. Baptists\xe2\x80\x99 congregational form of government allowed autonomy to local churches and prevented denominational leaders from dictating uniformity. Social sanctions and persuasion turned most Baptist ministers to grape juice in the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Supper by the turn of the century, yet some celebrated their freedom by persisting with wine. Rather than consuming their energy on sacred wine, Baptist leaders instead focused their attention on acting against the liquor business generally.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en54" href="part0020.html#ch01en54e">54</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">African American Baptists also divided on the issue of communion wine and embraced alcohol-free wine more slowly than their white co-religionists. Remarks in the minutes of the National Baptist Convention (NBC), the largest Black denomination (and for a time larger than the SBC), proved that many of its churches continued to use alcoholic wine in communion into the twentieth century. In their 1908 and 1909 reports, the NBC woman\xe2\x80\x99s auxiliary asked for the use of only unfermented wine in communion.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en55" href="part0020.html#ch01en55e">55</a></span> While most white Baptists had by this time either adopted grape juice in communion or made peace with those who persisted with wine, African American Baptists remained divided on communion wine into the twentieth century.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Some Catholics, on the other hand, insisted on Eucharistic wine to <span class="italic">enable</span> alcoholic abstinence. Official records of the Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America (CTAU), founded in 1872, called for abstinence from alcohol, but encouraged regular use of the sacraments\xe2\x80\x94including the wine-bearing Eucharist. J. B. Purcell, the first US bishop personally committed to total alcohol abstinence, emphasized that one could remain abstinent only by \xe2\x80\x9cthe frequent use of the Sacraments,\xe2\x80\x9d and other priests with similar advice appeared frequently in CTAU records.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en56" href="part0020.html#ch01en56e">56</a></span> For Catholics, who believed in transubstantiation, Eucharistic wine was not wine in substance, but transformed into the blood of Christ. For such Catholics, doing away with wine in communion did not help but rather would hinder the cause of abstinence, because the Eucharistic wine was an essential part of their connection with God in Christ, and that connection was necessary for their sobriety.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Columbia University professor John Erskine expressed an objection to nonalcoholic communion wine typical of high-church traditions: if the Eucharist with bread and wine was a central Christian practice, then taking away wine diminished that practice. The essence of Christian faith for Erskine was expressed in the \xe2\x80\x9cbeautiful metaphors\xe2\x80\x9d of Christ from the Gospel of John\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI am the Bread of Life\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI am the true Vine\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and there was no better way to express that truth than in communion with bread and wine.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en57" href="part0020.html#ch01en57e">57</a></span> Erskine claimed that \xe2\x80\x9cprohibition by professed Christians would be impossible if their faith were still warm in the heart or clear in the head, and that it has come now only because that faith is dead.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en58" href="part0020.html#ch01en58e">58</a></span> Ministers, he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cstill read out in the churches that Christ celebrated the Passover with His disciples, with the bread and wine of the ancient sacrifice,\xe2\x80\x9d and he then quoted the related Bible passage.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en59" href="part0020.html#ch01en59e">59</a></span> By objecting \xe2\x80\x9cto the wine as improper, as a temptation and a snare,\xe2\x80\x9d they are \xe2\x80\x9cgiving up, logically if unconsciously, any further concern with the mythical or metaphysical aspects of His nature, or with that inner sustenance of which the bread and wine were to be outward or visible signs.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en60" href="part0020.html#ch01en60e">60</a></span> Such an approach simplifies Christian faith so that \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps nothing will remain of it but an ecclesiastical system or a body of ethical doctrine for such as still revere the life [of Jesus] spent in Galilee.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en61" href="part0020.html#ch01en61e">61</a></span> If the mystical and spiritual union of the believer with Christ in communion was the essence of the Christian faith, then prohibitionists were gutting the heart of Christianity.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">For Erskine, as for Emerson, prohibitionists misinterpreted not only the Bible, but the tradition of the church. Since the catechisms for Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Lutherans, and Catholics alike explicitly mentioned wine as one of the elements to be received in communion, prohibitionists should insist upon reforming their catechisms before supporting prohibition.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en62" href="part0020.html#ch01en62e">62</a></span> Only by divorcing themselves from the traditional teachings of the church could Christians devote themselves so wholeheartedly to the innovation of prohibition. If Christians could select their communion elements at will, Erskine implied, then Christians denied that those elements had any meaning apart from what the church today felt like ascribing to them. Such a faith could pick and choose its practices and doctrines at will. By removing wine from the Eucharist, prohibition proved itself not to be a form of conservative Christianity, but a thoroughly modern innovation. In short, Erskine wondered \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the Eighteenth Amendment [for federal prohibition] is an amendment to the Constitution or to the New Testament.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en63" href="part0020.html#ch01en63e">63</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-a">Christian Liberty</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">On August 15, 1885, a fifty-six-year-old Episcopalian addressed a crowd of thousands in Waco, Texas, on the evils of political preaching.

The target of his ire was the campaign\xe2\x80\x94led by prominent clergy\xe2\x80\x94to dry the area in a local option election, which he claimed would result in a union of church and state. The speaker, Richard Coke, had considerable clout: he was a current US senator, the governor who ended Reconstruction in Texas, and a Confederate veteran who had served on Jefferson Davis\xe2\x80\x99s staff.

Carroll accurately countered that southern Democrats had written the local option in the Texas Constitution of 1876; there was nothing northern about it.

Liberty became a rallying cry for anti-prohibitionist Christians in several ways. Anticlericism, or an insistence upon separation between church leaders and the state, predominated among Christians in the South. Also, many Christians had championed liberty as limited government, while drys sought to impose morality by a powerful activist government.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Several historians have traced the dominance of anticlerical views in the South through the nineteenth century. Joe Coker argues that the South initially resisted prohibition in the late nineteenth century because, among other reasons, most southern whites believed in the spirituality of the church. This doctrine insisted that churches should not address or advocate directly on political issues, including prohibition, but was overcome by dry evangelical activism from the 1880s to the 1910s, transforming the region from a wet bastion to a dry stronghold.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en67" href="part0020.html#ch01en67e">67</a></span> Joseph Locke further develops this idea, contending that activism on prohibition played a key role in reshaping the South from an anticlerical region suspicious of the union of church and state to one that revered political preaching on many issues. Notwithstanding southern white evangelical ministers\xe2\x80\x99 support for slavery, secession, the Confederacy, and the Lost Cause before prohibition, the latter issue was instrumental in creating a distinctive form of religious politics of the \xe2\x80\x9cBible Belt,\xe2\x80\x9d which did not exist until the early twentieth century.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en68" href="part0020.html#ch01en68e">68</a></span> Following Locke, Robert Wuthnow briefly contends that prohibition activism was a prominent element in empowering political preaching in the South in the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en69" href="part0020.html#ch01en69e">69</a></span> Coker studied the eastern South (Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama) while Locke and Wuthnow focused on Texas, altogether demonstrating how this religious and political transformation of the South into the Bible Belt occurred across the region around the issue of prohibition.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Episcopalians, the epitome of elite whites in both the South and the North, generally believed that preachers should stay away from politics. Richard Coke, a Texas governor, US senator, and strident wet who was raised Episcopalian, articulated the popular view that wets were for southern, Democratic, and Christian values against foreign innovation and tyranny, an echo of the Confederate argument for regional self-determination on slavery.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en70" href="part0020.html#ch01en70e">70</a></span> Other Episcopalians agreed. An Episcopal newspaper, Austin\xe2\x80\x99s <span class="italic">Texas Churchman,</span> declared itself \xe2\x80\x9cemphatically in favor of temperance\xe2\x80\x9d yet against legal prohibition. \xe2\x80\x9cWill prohibition meet the case and convert the people into a nation of teetotalers? Vain delusion!\xe2\x80\x9d True temperance, the paper declared, could only be achieved by the church, not the state. In any case, it was not the church\xe2\x80\x99s business to interfere in politics.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en71" href="part0020.html#ch01en71e">71</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Even as American Protestants increasingly pursued personal abstinence from alcohol in the late nineteenth century, many declined to endorse prohibition. For much of the nineteenth century, many Baptists around the nation, white and Black alike, shared the theological precepts of J. Newton Brown\xe2\x80\x99s 1853 Church Covenant. That covenant was officially endorsed by the Black-led National Baptist Convention (NBC) in 1900, suggesting strong grassroots support for it in the decades leading up to that endorsement. The covenant explicitly called for members \xe2\x80\x9cto abstain from the sale and use of intoxicating drinks as a beverage.\xe2\x80\x9d However, it said nothing about prohibition laws. For many African American Baptists at the close of the nineteenth century, alcohol abstinence was a matter of personal piety and church practice, not public policy.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en72" href="part0020.html#ch01en72e">72</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">While anticlerical views reflected Protestant fears of Catholic influence, many American Catholics embraced the separation of church and politics. As a minority in a democratic society dominated by Protestants, Catholics in the United States generally sought a less intrusive government so they could work out their own salvation. Because Catholic tradition held that alcohol was not inherently sinful, Catholic temperance advocates generally preferred voluntary abstinence out of extraordinary need or piety rather than legal prohibition. Such was the norm in the largest Catholic temperance group in the nation, the Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America (CTAU). Founded in 1872 by clergy from around the nation, the CTAU was both anti-alcohol and anti-prohibition. The opening convention of the CTAU in 1872 issued an \xe2\x80\x9cAddress to the Catholics of America\xe2\x80\x9d insisting upon the motto of \xe2\x80\x9cMoral Suasion\xe2\x80\x9d while shunning \xe2\x80\x9cProhibitory laws, restrictive license systems, and special legislation against drunkenness.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en73" href="part0020.html#ch01en73e">73</a></span> At that same convention, Rev. James McDevitt of the District of Columbia argued that Catholics must work for abstinence \xe2\x80\x9con a strictly Catholic basis, discard all political considerations or means, and labor for the amelioration of the victims of intemperance through religious principles only.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en74" href="part0020.html#ch01en74e">74</a></span> Catholic religion, not political prohibition, guided Catholic temperance.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">A peculiarly Catholic element in the CTAU\xe2\x80\x99s abstinence pledge\xe2\x80\x94a requirement for all CTAU members\xe2\x80\x94was the thirst of Christ on the Cross. The pledge began: \xe2\x80\x9cI promise, with the Divine assistance and in honor of the Sacred Thirst and Agony of Our Savior, to abstain from all intoxicating drinks.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en75" href="part0020.html#ch01en75e">75</a></span> The pledge implied that, by the agonies of abstaining from drink even in moments of weakness, pledge takers relied upon Christ\xe2\x80\x99s help as they identified with his sufferings on the cross.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en76" href="part0020.html#ch01en76e">76</a></span> By 1907, the CTAU had enlisted over a 100,000 Catholics with chapters in many southern states, including Louisiana and Alabama.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en77" href="part0020.html#ch01en77e">77</a></span> Even in the Deep South, some Catholics embraced alcohol abstinence\xe2\x80\x94but through their church, not by legal prohibition through the state.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Evangelical Protestants\xe2\x80\x99 theological differences with Catholics and more liturgical Protestants influenced their views on prohibition. Evangelicals believed in a sudden conversion experience, immediate moral change, and the aspiration of ever-greater holiness for all believers. However, Catholics and more liturgical Protestants tended to view salvation as sacramental, to see holiness as the result of slow progress rather than a sudden event, and to tolerate vices such as heavier drinking habits. Attempting to impose rapid moral development on all people by strict religious laws fit better with the rapidly changing circumstances and evolving theology of American Protestants than with traditionally minded high-church Episcopalians, Lutherans, and Catholics.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en78" href="part0020.html#ch01en78e">78</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">In addition to questioning the politicization of the church for prohibition, many Christian wets in the South believed that dry laws violated their liberty by abandoning the sacrosanct principle of limited government. White southerners throughout the nineteenth century typically held to the Jeffersonian view that divisive moral issues such as alcohol were best left to individuals, families, communities, and local government rather than the state or federal government. This localist critique had roots in the American Revolution and carried weight in the South, which had fought the Civil War to protect their regional practice of slavery and long after the war invoked the rights of each state and locale to settle contentious moral issues.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The notion of limited government also had roots in classical Christian theology, which taught that individuals built righteous character by overcoming temptation through self-control, Christian community, and divine assistance. This traditional Christian position opposed prohibition, which attempted to use the state to prevent sin by removing temptation. Rather than merely exhorting parishioners to overcome bondage to drunkenness by moderate drinking or voluntary abstention, dry ministers saw demon rum as inexorable, requiring not merely individual willpower or church support but state intervention. For prohibitionists, the locus of godly social reform thus shifted from the church to the state, with the church playing a secondary role as a pressure group to ensure the progressive advancement of human morality\xe2\x80\x94not through the regeneration of souls by the power of the Holy Spirit but the coercion of bodies by the power of government. By replacing the roles of God and the church with the state, prohibition made government control all-important, turned the issue into a holy culture war that justified almost any means to achieve its end, and effectively secularized the church\xe2\x80\x99s function while attempting to sacralize the state.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s rise prompted church leaders to clamp down on dissident voices and enforce ideological uniformity on a political issue. This happened not only among Methodists, who already had a top-down structure, but increasingly among liberty-loving Baptists, who celebrated congregational autonomy and soul liberty to follow one\xe2\x80\x99s individual conscience on secondary matters. Even Baptists, who in colonial Virginia had sometimes been imprisoned for defying the Anglican establishment, sought to impose their own moral vision on the South a century later as they gained cultural and political power.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">By the 1870s, some Southern Baptists began advocating prohibition, yet they were out of step with most Baptists and Christian tradition. Baptists generally agreed that wine was permitted in the Bible and even consumed by Jesus, yet dry Baptists primarily relied on arguments from common-sense reasoning and contemporary experience. In 1875, the Baptist State Convention of Texas\xe2\x80\x99s Committee on Temperance cataloged the evils of the liquor traffic: it wasted $900 million and murdered more than sixty thousand people annually; it generated 75 percent of crime and most of the poverty and insanity; and was \xe2\x80\x9ccorrupting the ballot box,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chastening monopoly,\xe2\x80\x9d and even \xe2\x80\x9cplanting the seeds of communism.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en79" href="part0020.html#ch01en79e">79</a></span> These concerns were all contemporary and contingent\xe2\x80\x94particularly matters such as elections, monopolies, and communism\xe2\x80\x94rather than being based on eternal values from Scripture or tradition. Still, many Southern Baptists then favored moderate drinking, believed only the Gospel could cure a drunkard, and shunned politically lobbying for prohibition. Southern Methodists in the mid-1870s likewise focused more on strict abstinence among their members than in passing prohibition laws.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">White Baptist preachers defended prohibition advocacy as their Christian duty to resist evil. Responding directly to Senator Coke\xe2\x80\x99s call to put political preachers in their place, the \xe2\x80\x9cold time Baptist\xe2\x80\x9d preacher I. B. Kimbrough pronounced in 1887 at the Baptist State Convention that he would rather \xe2\x80\x9clive on corn cobs and stump water\xe2\x80\x9d than \xe2\x80\x9callow any politician to put a padlock on my mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en80" href="part0020.html#ch01en80e">80</a></span> The language inverted the wet rhetoric against political preachers as power-hungry and gave them the moral high ground as saints suffering for freedom of speech. While southern clergy asserted regional distinctiveness, their dry campaign also tied them into a national movement to advance Christian values.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The issue of prohibition also led Baptist churches to modify their traditional emphasis on congregational autonomy. Though state conventions of the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) had never before exercised authority over local congregations, according to historian Rufus Spain, various state conventions in the 1870s began threatening to cut off churches who did not properly discipline their members to avoid involvement in the alcohol trade. While Baptist churches had long since punished saloon operators and drunkards, Baptist churches began using social sanctions against those involved in the alcohol industry more generally: brewers, distillers, liquor wholesalers, or even property owners who rented land to them. Florida passed such a resolution in 1872, followed by Georgia in 1873, Texas in 1876, and Mississippi in 1878. While churches or individuals could flout them, such resolutions had an overall chilling effect on those involved in the alcohol trade. Still, in the 1870s, these were just several states in the SBC, not the whole denomination.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The turning point for white Methodists and Baptists across the South on prohibition was 1886. That year, the Methodist General Conference (Southern Methodists) denounced the manufacture and sale of alcoholic drinks as sins. After that, the denomination plunged into prohibition advocacy even as they continued using moral suasion within their churches.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en81" href="part0020.html#ch01en81e">81</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">While the Methodist hierarchy backed prohibition, some lay Methodists opposed it. Roger Quarles Mills, a Methodist from Corsicana, had been an ardent prohibitionist with his own dry monthly paper, <span class="italic">Prairie Blade.</span> One 1855 issue compared the argument that liquor is good because it brings in tax revenue to the argument that \xe2\x80\x9ca maiden should sell her virtue or a man his honesty for gold or silver.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en82" href="part0020.html#ch01en82e">82</a></span> Yet by 1887, Mills, a former US representative and future US senator, had joined the wet \xe2\x80\x9cTrue Blues,\xe2\x80\x9d contending that legal prohibition undermined Jeffersonian democracy. Mills withdrew from the Southern Methodist denomination to protest constant \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical preaching,\xe2\x80\x9d and in a debate with B. H. Carroll retorted, \xe2\x80\x9cHell is full of better preachers than that man, so full that their legs are hanging out at the windows.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en83" href="part0020.html#ch01en83e">83</a></span> While some Methodist laymen were convicted by their preachers to vote dry, others grew alienated and left because of the political preaching.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">As with Methodists, the SBC\xe2\x80\x99s first temperance resolution in 1886 was a sea change. Support for local option laws slowly morphed into support for statewide and national prohibition by the 1890s. Nonetheless, Southern Baptists did not see temperance as all-important: most denounced the Prohibition Party for undermining white supremacy by threatening the Democratic Party\xe2\x80\x99s stranglehold on the region.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en84" href="part0020.html#ch01en84e">84</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The endorsement of legal prohibition among Baptists represented a decisive shift from church-led moral suasion to state-enforced laws. As the Texas Baptists\xe2\x80\x99 Temperance Report from 1886 stated, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98moral suasion\xe2\x80\x99 has been rung in our ears so long by those who never did anything <span class="italic">for</span> moral suasion\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis original) that it \xe2\x80\x9chas ceased to be potent.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en85" href="part0020.html#ch01en85e">85</a></span> The report also noted that the government had never enforced local prohibition laws and saloon operators often flouted them\xe2\x80\x94a curious argument to lobby for <span class="italic">more</span> laws. Baptists must \xe2\x80\x9cas citizens <span class="small-caps2">VOTE</span> against this hydra-headed monster,\xe2\x80\x9d since \xe2\x80\x9cit is our duty as Christians to vote for prohibition\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfor God, and home, and native land\xe2\x80\x9d (the motto of the WCTU). If dry activism should lead to a backlash, the committee urged, \xe2\x80\x9clet us force the boycott.\xe2\x80\x9d The report then invoked Psalm 2 (\xe2\x80\x9clet the heathen rage\xe2\x80\x9d) and the Declaration of Independence (\xe2\x80\x9clet us pledge our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor\xe2\x80\x9d) to inspire their comrades against \xe2\x80\x9cthis greatest of all iniquities\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94alcohol. Texas Baptists adopted the whole report, indicating that the time for old-fashioned moral suasion was over.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en86" href="part0020.html#ch01en86e">86</a></span> Their American experience and identity had redefined the very meaning of Christian liberty.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Then in 1896, the SBC itself issued a resolution that not only endorsed prohibition, but also promised action against any Baptist who did any business with the liquor traffic. The resolution read:</p>\n<p class="x-ex-np">We announce it as the sense of this body that no person should be retained in the fellowship of a Baptist church who engages in the manufacture or sale of alcoholic liquors, either at wholesale or retail, who invests his money in the manufacture or sale of alcoholic liquors, or who rents his property to be used for distilleries, wholesale liquor houses or saloon. Nor do we believe that any church should retain in its fellowship any member who drinks intoxicating liquors as a beverage, or visits saloons or drinking places for the purpose of such indulgence.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Though the SBC had no mechanism to enforce compliance, the power of state conventions could bar individual churches from their fellowship. By 1900, every Southern Baptist state convention save North Carolina had passed similar resolutions, which pressured their churches to comply. With these declarations, prohibition advocacy became a defining issue of Southern Baptist identity. It seems fitting that the main nineteenth-century social issue on which Southern Baptists demanded new government regulations also led state conventions to exert more direct control over churches. Baptists\xe2\x80\x99 increasing advocacy for alcohol prohibition by law paralleled their diminishing tolerance of dissenting views on alcohol in church government.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en87" href="part0020.html#ch01en87e">87</a></span> Rather than pursuing anticlerical politics and limited government, white evangelicals in the South reinterpreted temperance to mean a total war against alcohol that demanded its unconditional surrender through state-mandated prohibition.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">While more traditionalist Christians favored working out their salvation apart from state interference, prohibitionists insisted that an enlarged government played a necessary part in attaining salvation from demon rum. Scholars like Richard Hamm, Ann-Marie Szymanski, and Lisa McGirr have made clear how prohibitionists contributed to the development of a more powerful federal government.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en88" href="part0020.html#ch01en88e">88</a></span> Prohibition also profoundly changed the South\xe2\x80\x99s perception of progressive, interventionist government on the state level. Despite the South\xe2\x80\x99s reputation for Jeffersonian Democracy and local rule, various scholars have pointed out how prohibition in the South was profoundly linked to the progressive movement and trademark streamlining of government. As Szymanski observed, the South grew more progressive through embracing prohibition, but she rejects the claim that the South\xe2\x80\x99s turn to progressivism came from chiefly northern influence, as William A. Link, Paul L. Harvey, and others have contended. Instead, she argues persuasively that southern progressives\xe2\x80\x99 approach to prohibition by gradual measures and local option often were more effective than more sudden and statewide approaches popular in the North. As a result, prohibition laws lasted much longer in the South than the rest of the nation. Whether or not progressivism in the South was mostly indigenous or imported, it was profoundly linked to radical changes in how southerners looked to government, from child labor laws to taxation reform. Thomas R. Pegram sums up a consensus among prohibition scholars by putting the reform at the forefront of a dramatic change for the Jeffersonian South: \xe2\x80\x9c[P]rohibition was a doorway to a host of reforms that entailed expanded state regulation over personal liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en89" href="part0020.html#ch01en89e">89</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-a">Conclusion</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Traditional Christian views on temperance, the Bible, communion wine, and liberty all resisted the American innovation of alcohol prohibition. Despite citing Scripture to suit their own purposes, drys broke with classical morality, the example of Jesus, Christian ceremonies, and American traditions to advance their novel Gospel of prohibition. The truly traditionalist Christians were not drys, but wets.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The communion wine question still divides Christians today. Millions every Sunday imbibe grape juice at communion without considering how truly modern that drink is. Given the fierce debates within Baptist and Methodist churches over the issue, it is remarkable that during national prohibition neither federal nor state governments sought to prevent the production or consumption of sacred wine. It remains an open question how much of their Christian past prohibitionists left behind when they chose the cup of Dr. Welch over the cup of their spiritual forebears.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Decades after the Civil War resolved the theological and political crisis of slavery, Christians who read the same Bible and prayed to the same God continued to deploy theology and Scripture on both sides of a culture war, this time over prohibition. White evangelical drys continued to approach the Bible the same way most US citizens did up to the Civil War: with an individualist, republican, common-sense hermeneutic. This hermeneutic democratized the interpretation of the Bible and gave readers a sense of the certainty of their readings directly with the text apart from the traditional teachings and practices of the church.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en90" href="part0020.html#ch01en90e">90</a></span> Many today still invoke Christian faith for contemporary politics, and then as now, they do so on both sides of the culture wars.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Having taken a stance against Christian tradition for prohibition, white evangelical drys throughout the South took the political offensive in the 1880s, testing their political strength for the first time through a series of statewide and local prohibition campaigns. These referenda challenged southern traditions in three other areas: race, gender, and party unity. While drys\xe2\x80\x99 early efforts to dry up the Bourbon South mostly failed, they began a movement that challenged the region\xe2\x80\x99s norms and would eventually transform it into the Bible Belt.</p>\n</body></html>\n'</p>

He moved to Kentucky in 1785 or 1786 and gained a reputation as a greater preacher than his brothers Joseph and Lewis, who were also Baptist pioneers there. Elijah\xe2\x80\x99s preaching voice was \xe2\x80\x9clike the loud sound of a sweet trumpet\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9ccommonly brought many tears from the hearers\xe2\x80\x9d and converted many. He was also an entrepreneur: he built Kentucky\xe2\x80\x99s first sawmill, made rope, fulled cloth, and founded a bourbon distillery around 1789. He was known for church controversies and spent most of his money chasing after new business ventures, leaving his family poor when he died in May 1808. Yet the <span class="italic">Kentucky Gazette</span> eulogized him: \xe2\x80\x9cIf virtue consists in being useful to our fellow citizens, perhaps there were few more virtuous men than Mr. Craig.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en2" href="part0020.html#ch01en2e">2</a></span> At least in the early nineteenth century, distilling bourbon was a mark of virtue for a Baptist minister.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Elijah Craig\xe2\x80\x99s story illustrates how some pious southerners in the nineteenth century saw no need to choose between liquor and the Lord. Even strict Baptists tolerated crafting, selling, and drinking high-proof distilled beverages, to say nothing of fermented beverages such as wine and beer with less alcoholic content. Permissive attitudes to intoxicating drinks persisted amid early nineteenth-century revivals, commonly called the Second Great Awakening, and most southerners carried these views with them to the late nineteenth century. This permissive attitude toward alcohol stretched back much further than the colonial era; it continued a millennia-long Judeo-Christian tradition of appreciation for both common and consecrated drinks.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Traditional Christian attitudes towards alcoholic beverages tended to oppose prohibition in four areas. While classical Christian views of temperance meant moderate use, prohibitionists\xe2\x80\x99 insistence on total abstinence from alcohol more closely followed Islamic teaching. Passages of the Bible also supported moderate alcohol use, particularly regarding wine. The celebration of Christian communion had always involved sacred wine until the nineteenth-century innovation of grape juice. And early American views on Christian liberty, particularly in the South, emphasized limited government and anticlerical politics.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Church structure mattered in these debates. Top-down Methodists tended to be more united, better organized, and earlier supporters of prohibition than bottom-up Baptists. Theology also mattered. \xe2\x80\x9cHigh church\xe2\x80\x9d groups such as Catholics, Episcopalians, and Lutherans tended to defer to traditional readings favoring wine in communion and at home, while relatively \xe2\x80\x9clow church\xe2\x80\x9d denominations such as Baptists, Methodists, and Presbyterians were more likely to defy ancient tradition and embrace theological novelties such as prohibition.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The American transformation from traditional views on temperance, the Bible, communion, and liberty to the modern innovation of prohibition was facilitated by a remarkable shift in how American Christians derived their spiritual authority from a common-sense, republican, individualist reading of the Bible. As changing circumstances and modern science revealed new threats from alcohol abuse, many American Christians used Scripture to defend a totalistic rejection of alcoholic drinks. They argued for alcohol abstinence on the grounds of experience, expediency, and proper application of general Christian principles, though even some prohibitionists admitted that the Bible did not forbid drinking as such.

Only in modern times did temperance take on a connection with alcohol. Following Aristotle\xe2\x80\x99s notion of finding virtue between two extremes, ancient and medieval theologians developed articulations of Christian virtue that rested between the extreme vices of excess and deficiency. For such theologians and philosophers, temperance lay between the excess of self-indulgence, which was common and dangerous, and the deficiency of shunning pleasure, which was so rare in Aristotle\xe2\x80\x99s time that he invented a name for it: \xe2\x80\x9cinsensibility.\xe2\x80\x9d The great medieval Catholic theologian Thomas Aquinas explicitly tackled the issue of whether shunning pleasure could be considered a vice and concluded that abstinence could be praiseworthy or necessary in certain circumstances for the sake of physical or spiritual health, but even so pleasure ought not to be shunned altogether.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en3" href="part0020.html#ch01en3e">3</a></span> Translating the virtue to alcohol use, self-indulgence meant drunkenness, insensibility meant abstinence, and temperance meant moderate drinking.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Given this long-standing understanding of temperance, prohibition would have seemed absurd to Americans before the nineteenth century. Even the exacting Pilgrims and Puritans of seventeenth-century New England had no problem with fermented spirits; the Mayflower was well-stocked with them. The Puritan Francis Higginson sailed for Massachusetts Bay in 1629 with forty-five casks of beer and twenty gallons of brandy for his Puritan relatives and community, and Jonathan Edwards\xe2\x80\x99s father enjoyed an ordination party in 1698 provisioned with four quarts of rum and eight quarts of wine. Increase Mather preached that \xe2\x80\x9cwine is from God\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cthe drunkard is from the Devil.\xe2\x80\x9d Historian Mark Noll notes that some scholars think Increase\xe2\x80\x99s son Cotton Mather coined the phrase, but if so, he was echoing Increase\xe2\x80\x99s words from 1673: \xe2\x80\x9cDrink is in itself a creature from God, and to be received with thankfulness.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en4" href="part0020.html#ch01en4e">4</a></span> Early Americans followed classical Christian theology to argue that alcoholic beverages were God-given, so insisting upon complete abstinence was not virtue but vice.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">If early Puritans in colonial New England could and did distinguish alcohol\xe2\x80\x99s good and evil uses, the denizens of the US South had even fewer qualms about alcohol. Even by the accounts of Ernest Cherrington, a prolific researcher for the Anti-Saloon League, colonial Americans had \xe2\x80\x9cno condemnation of intoxicating liquors as such,\xe2\x80\x9d and even though use of alcoholic drinks \xe2\x80\x9cincreased by leaps and bounds,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cmoral and religious forces\xe2\x80\x9d of the day had \xe2\x80\x9cno attitude of hostility to intoxicants,\xe2\x80\x9d but only against drunkenness.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en5" href="part0020.html#ch01en5e">5</a></span> Indeed, liquors \xe2\x80\x9cin themselves were considered wholesome and necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d and when taken in \xe2\x80\x9cmoderation . . . were considered helpful and stimulating.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en6" href="part0020.html#ch01en6e">6</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">This classical notion of temperance enjoyed widespread acceptance by American Christians until the early nineteenth century, when alcoholism in the United States reached epidemic proportions. Advances in distilling technology, the profitability of converting grain crops into alcoholic beverages, the replacement of milder beverages like beer and cider with stronger drinks like whiskey, and social acceptance of heavier drinking was turning the United States after the Revolution into the \xe2\x80\x9cAlcohol Republic,\xe2\x80\x9d as historian W. J. Rorabaugh put it. By 1830, an average American over fifteen years old drank eighty-eight bottles of whiskey annually, nearly three times the average today. Drinking became synonymous with drunkenness. These excesses prompted reformers like Lyman Beecher to form in 1826 the American Temperance Society (ATS) and to spearhead a national temperance movement against the destructive influences of alcohol. Temperance advocates initially preferred moral suasion to combat the evils of demon rum. The Virginia ATS chapter in 1827, for example, denounced the \xe2\x80\x9cintemperate use of spirituous liquors\xe2\x80\x9d but did not call for total abstinence, much less for prohibition.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en7" href="part0020.html#ch01en7e">7</a></span> Prohibitionists, however, insisted upon wielding the moral force of the state to eliminate the very temptation to drink by outlawing the production and sale of alcohol.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en8" href="part0020.html#ch01en8e">8</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Why did prohibitionists break with Christian tradition by adopting such a radical approach of not only abstinence, but legal prohibition? The answer lies in part in the changes in religious sensibilities between the American Revolution and the Civil War. During that time, most Protestants in the United States increasingly based their faith on individualistic, republican, and common-sense readings of the Bible. This new consensus replaced more traditional Christian views (even among Protestants) that revered community authority, expert exegesis, and hierarchy. Mark Noll, Nathan O. Hatch, and others have observed that this alliance between representative government and Christianity was by no means obvious or natural but was remarkably innovative for a faith that had been defined through hierarchical relationships and community consensus. In short, most American Protestants had already broken dramatically with Christian tradition by aligning it to individualistic common sense, which made it more likely for American Christians to adopt innovations that were unconnected or even opposed to classical Christian teachings, including alcohol abstinence and prohibition.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en9" href="part0020.html#ch01en9e">9</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Various learned laymen across the nation took up the pen to expose prohibition as an innovation that had more to do with legalistic Islam than with classic Christianity. In 1867, John A. Andrew of Boston spoke out at a public forum against \xe2\x80\x9cthose who would rest the hopes of humanity on the commandments of men\xe2\x80\x9d such as prohibition and pointed instead to \xe2\x80\x9cthe promises of Gospel Grace\xe2\x80\x9d as the effective means to live truly temperate lives. He also pointed to the positive reforms of England in that century, citing the people\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c[r]eligious faith, Christian charity, philanthropic benevolence,\xe2\x80\x9d and other virtues in all levels of society, which \xe2\x80\x9cnow battle effectually against the vices of society, and the evil inclinations of human nature.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThis progress,\xe2\x80\x9d he claimed, \xe2\x80\x9cwas not Jewish, nor Mohammedan, but it was Christian. It was not due to law, but to liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d He believed the most effective way of combating vice among all classes was Christian faith and virtue stemming from liberty, not the legalism he saw in other religions.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en10" href="part0020.html#ch01en10e">10</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Some Christians in the South shared this perception. Alexander Watkins Terrell, a Texas state senator who later became a chief architect of the state\xe2\x80\x99s dry poll-tax law, also denounced prohibition in 1879. On the one hand, he claimed that centuries of Islamic prohibition on alcohol led to the gradual \xe2\x80\x9cphysical and moral decay\xe2\x80\x9d of the Turks. On the other hand, he objected to banning wine, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich the Savior himself once made by his miraculous power, to cheer the heart of a bridegroom and his guests, and against the temperate use of which He never uttered a word during all his pilgrimage on earth.\xe2\x80\x9d For Terrell and his constituents, temperate alcohol use was on the side of Jesus and freedom, while prohibitionists were on the side of Muhammad and regression.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en11" href="part0020.html#ch01en11e">11</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-a">The Bible and Booze</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">As Terrell\xe2\x80\x99s reference to Jesus turning water into wine in John 2 indicated, wets could cite the Bible for their cause just as well as, if not better than, their dry opponents. This seems to challenge Mark Noll\xe2\x80\x99s observation that popular recourse to the Bible as authoritative for a major US political crisis occurred for the last time regarding slavery. The dominant approach in that theological and moral debate was a common-sense hermeneutic that valued individuals\xe2\x80\x99 interpretations of the Bible over church tradition and magisterial authority, which left only the violence of the Civil War as a viable option to overcome the impasse over slavery.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en12" href="part0020.html#ch01en12e">12</a></span> Following the conflict, ordinary people in the United States displaced debates over Bible passages from the public discourse because, without recourse to an outside authority like church tradition, it was open to conflicting interpretations and so failed to provide the means to resolve the issue of slavery apart from devastating Civil War.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en13" href="part0020.html#ch01en13e">13</a></span> When it came to prohibition, however, both drys and wets freely wielded the Bible for their cause, suggesting that the Bible still carried weight in the postbellum United States.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The American prohibition movement sprang not from literal interpretations of the Bible but from Americans\xe2\x80\x99 experience. Drinking became a serious problem for many churches around the nation after the Civil War, but most Southern Baptists did not immediately call for prohibition, even if they did recommend abstinence from alcohol. The official newspaper of the Baptist General Association of Virginia recommended in October of 1865 that only teetotalism could prevent drunkenness, but five years later admitted that such behavior was not demanded by the Bible: \xe2\x80\x9cTotal abstinence from intoxicating liquors, with certain limitations, is commended by expediency, the experience of multitudes, the opinion of many wise and good men, and by a fair application of certain scriptural principles.\xe2\x80\x9d Still, they admitted \xe2\x80\x9cthe Bible contains no prohibition of the use of wine and strong drink, and all attempts to draw such a prohibition from it is a perversion of Scripture, and injurious to the cause which it is intended to subserve.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en14" href="part0020.html#ch01en14e">14</a></span> In 1870, Southern Baptists had not yet claimed the Bible directly supported alcohol abstinence, much less prohibition.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Skepticism about the wisdom of using the Bible to insist on abstinence persisted among Southern Baptists until the 1880s. A few voices in major Baptist periodicals argued for moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages, including hard liquor, as late as 1884. After a consensus emerged that distilled liquors were unacceptable drinks for serious Christians, some Baptists continued to suggest that the best antidote for intemperance was moderate consumption of wine, beer, cider, and other malt drinks that occurred naturally and featured less alcoholic content. Even these modest allowances were frequently countered by observations that excessive drinking of any alcoholic beverage could easily lead to drunkenness.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en15" href="part0020.html#ch01en15e">15</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The hardest drink habit for Southern Baptists to kick was wine. Many southerners considered wine the most innocuous of alcoholic beverages. Farm columns in Baptist journals such as the Atlanta <span class="italic">Christian Index</span> included wine recipes and encouragement to produce diversified crops for the manufacture of wines from various fruits, including blackberries, strawberries, and scuppernongs.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en16" href="part0020.html#ch01en16e">16</a></span> Baptist writers also acknowledged that wine was encouraged in the Bible. St. Paul urged his prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 in 1 Timothy 5:23 to \xe2\x80\x9ctake a little wine\xe2\x80\x9d for his health, and Jesus famously turned water into wine in a wedding in John 2. \xe2\x80\x9cWe fully believe,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote one contributor to the Richmond, Virginia, <span class="italic">Religious Herald </span>in 1879, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the wine made by Christ at the marriage in Cana was intoxicating, if drunk to excess.\xe2\x80\x9d Another stated, \xe2\x80\x9cThat Christ drank wine during His stay on earth, no one can doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en17" href="part0020.html#ch01en17e">17</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Nonetheless, many Southern Baptists insisted upon shunning wine despite the examples in the Bible because they interpreted their faith according to a common-sense understanding of their own times. Baptist icon John A. Broadus of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary granted that Jesus used wine in the first century but claimed that Christ only drank it because of cultural custom. Had Jesus lived in the present, Broadus insisted, he would have shunned wine and preferred more respectable drinks like tea or coffee. A Virginian editor in 1888 urged teetotalers: if they would focus on \xe2\x80\x9cpresent facts and present dangers\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cabandon all attempts to find an explicit Bible command, what a relief it would be to them and to the cause!\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en18" href="part0020.html#ch01en18e">18</a></span> By the 1890s, Southern Baptists had hardened their views against alcohol as the greatest vice, though this view sprang from experience rather than the Bible. The Florida Baptist Convention called alcohol the most \xe2\x80\x9cdestructive curse of the 19th century, imperiling our homes, hostile to our churches, a constant menace to society, the prolific mother of vice and crime, the corrupter of politics, a breeder of anarchy in our government, and in all its dark record the offspring of the devil.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en19" href="part0020.html#ch01en19e">19</a></span> For Southern Baptist drys in the late nineteenth century, appeals to common sense and present realities trumped clear biblical examples condoning alcohol consumption.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Methodists banned alcohol consumption before Baptists, though experience and reason had more to do with the proscription than Scripture or tradition. John Wesley established the rule forbidding \xe2\x80\x9cDrunkenness, or drinking spirituous liquors unless in cases of necessity,\xe2\x80\x9d for his followers in the eighteenth century. While British Methodists threatened to ban members for drinking liquor as early as 1795, American Methodists\xe2\x80\x99 book of discipline in use at that time did not mention drinking, though it did banish people who talked before church. By the 1870s, however, the white-led Southern Methodist and Northern Methodist denominations both included the rule against drunkenness and distilled drinks. Even then, \xe2\x80\x9cspiritous liquors\xe2\x80\x9d meant distilled beverages and excluded fermented drinks with lower alcoholic content such as beer and wine.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en20" href="part0020.html#ch01en20e">20</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">In the nineteenth century, white and Black American Methodists began to embrace alcohol abstinence and then prohibition.

This thesis claimed that the Bible referred two kinds of wine: a nonalcoholic wine for all positive references, and an alcoholic wine for all negative references. Hundreds of educated American clergy around the nation objected to the two-wine thesis in 1888, including the Rev. Edward Hurtt Jewett. Using references to the original Hebrew and Greek texts of the Bible, Jewett argued that \xe2\x80\x9cthe term <span class="italic">unfermented</span> wine, in Scripture phraseology, is a misnomer and self-contradictory,\xe2\x80\x9d since wine was always presumed to have been fermented.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en31" href="part0020.html#ch01en31e">31</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Some years later, Edward R.

This debate on Bible wines either waned in 1890 because prohibitionists had won or, more likely, because Baptists agreed to disagree and focus on more important matters, since the debate over prohibition was not resolved in the SBC until 1896.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en40" href="part0020.html#ch01en40e">40</a></span> Wets like Jewett and Emerson interpreted the Bible through philology and history, yet they also argued from a plain reading of the Bible according to church tradition and common sense. Prohibitionists also appealed to philology and history to reinterpret the Bible, but the argument mattered only because many on both sides viewed the Bible as Scripture.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">However, some nineteenth-century prohibitionists publicly rejected the Bible as Scripture, including Elizabeth Cady Stanton. An early advocate for prohibition, Stanton turned away from evangelical Christianity before reaching adulthood. By the 1890s, Stanton grew convinced that Christianity and the Bible were inimical to gender equality and had to be confronted. She initiated the <span class="italic">Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Bible,</span> a collaborative project in which she and other women offered commentary on Bible passages that dealt directly with women, especially those used by opponents of gender equality. Consequently, she and other religious radicals were marginalized from both the suffrage and temperance movements by the end of the nineteenth century. Nonetheless, the fact that heterodox women such as Stanton had played key roles in the earlier temperance movement suggested their continued presence in the movement in years to come.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en41" href="part0020.html#ch01en41e">41</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Prohibitionists who invoked the Bible differed on how literally to interpret it and on whether prohibition was primarily about saving individual souls or redeeming society. Temperance literature in the nineteenth century often contained variants of, \xe2\x80\x9cNo drunkard . . . shall inherit the kingdom of God,\xe2\x80\x9d from 1 Corinthians 6:10,<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en42" href="part0020.html#ch01en42e">42</a></span> and a few leading drys repeated this claim in the twentieth century. Ferdinand Iglehart dedicated his celebration of prohibition, <span class="italic">King Alcohol Dethroned,</span> to the salvation of souls: \xe2\x80\x9cThis book goes out with the hope that it may reclaim some drunkard . . . that some soul may be saved for time and eternity.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en43" href="part0020.html#ch01en43e">43</a></span> However, this fear of hell was not shared by progressive prohibitionists such as the modernist Presbyterian Charles Stelzle, who took a leading role in the Social Gospel movement to reform society according to Christian principles and modern scientific management. In his defense of dry laws, <span class="italic">Why Prohibition!,</span> Stelzle mocked the idea of people going to hell as something the fundamentalist revivalist \xe2\x80\x9cBilly Sunday says.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en44" href="part0020.html#ch01en44e">44</a></span> Thus, Christian prohibitionists were divided between fundamentalists like Sunday, whose concern to save souls through prohibition was rooted in a common-sense evangelical interpretation of the Bible, and modernists like Stelzle, who mocked their concern and shunned such a literal reading of Scripture.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The Bible could and did play on both sides of the prohibition divide, though some prohibitionists treated it as peripheral or nonessential to their cause while anti-prohibitionists at times invoked the Bible more effectively. Baptists sometimes admitted that one could not reasonably argue for prohibition from the Bible and that Jesus drank and made wine. Only by applying contemporary culture and experiences could Christians conclude that alcohol must be shunned. Christians on both sides often resorted to extra-biblical arguments rather than trusting Scripture alone to resolve the issue. Whether supported by the Bible or not, once prohibitionists viewed alcohol as evil, the struggle expanded beyond prohibition to the question of wine in communion.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Communion Wine</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">On Christmas Day 1838, in the Masonic Lodge of Matagorda, the first Episcopalian Eucharist in the Republic of Texas was celebrated.

The Christian tradition of wine in the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Supper derived from the Jewish custom of Seder dinner, with its four cups of wine. Since at least the first century, ancient Christians began meeting together over bread and wine. The tradition gradually transitioned from a \xe2\x80\x9clove feast\xe2\x80\x9d meal to a highly structured ritual in which a priest distributed wafers and sips of wine. For most medieval peasants, communion wine remained in sight but out of reach, reserved for priests. Though greatly changed, two constants remained: bread and wine.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The Reformation democratized the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Supper. The English <span class="italic">Book of Common Prayer</span> made worship more accessible in many ways: services were in the English vernacular, the altar became a table closer to the people, and everyone was encouraged to partake of both bread and wine weekly. Ironically, even as Protestant doctrine made the Eucharist more accessible, Protestant anxiety about taking the Eucharist improperly led to communion becoming less frequent and less important in Protestant worship just as the Council of Trent ordered every faithful Catholic to partake in communion at each mass.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en47" href="part0020.html#ch01en47e">47</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The centuries-old assumptions that communion should feature fermented wine came under attack in innovative America. In 1869, a British-born Wesleyan Methodist named Thomas Bramwell Welch invented a pasteurization method to prevent the fermentation of grape juice. Though other methods previously existed to create nonalcoholic grape juice, and Welch\xe2\x80\x99s own Wesleyan Methodist denomination had explicitly required nonalcoholic wine for communion since 1843, Welch\xe2\x80\x99s method could produce higher-quality juice in larger quantities than other techniques. Welch encouraged churches to use his \xe2\x80\x9cunfermented wine,\xe2\x80\x9d and his sales increased commensurately with the growing popularity of prohibition.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en48" href="part0020.html#ch01en48e">48</a></span> As the nineteenth century closed, more American Christians came to believe that personal experience, common sense, and modern science were incompatible with the doctrine that alcoholic beverages should be used in the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Supper. As Jennifer L. Woodruff Tait<span class="superscript"> </span>argues, the move to replace communion wine with grape juice among Methodists represented \xe2\x80\x9cthe natural result of applying the common-sense worldview to the temperance problem.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en49" href="part0020.html#ch01en49e">49</a></span> Some churches forsook alcohol while others revered it. These divides over alcohol suggested that the historical peculiarities of denominations and theological traditions affected their approach to the issue of communion wine. Since Tait has provided an excellent description of these shifts in Methodist churches, much of the following analysis will focus on a few other Christian groups, starting with Baptists.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Some Baptists preferred to keep alcohol in their sacred wine. From 1886 to 1890, the main argument among Baptists had shifted from whether alcoholic beverages were generally permissible (they were not) to whether they should use wine or grape juice in communion. Though Baptists viewed communion as an ordinance, or command to be followed, rather than a sacrament, or a means of God\xe2\x80\x99s grace, they took ordinances seriously. The very name \xe2\x80\x9cBaptist\xe2\x80\x9d referred to their only other ordinance, baptism, on which they staked their denominational identity. Since Baptists insisted upon the biblical model of baptism\xe2\x80\x94full immersion for believing adults only\xe2\x80\x94how could they justify using anything other than wine for communion? \xe2\x80\x9cIf we must have real water for baptism and not some substitute for it,\xe2\x80\x9d a Baptist from Florida asked, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy not have real wine for the supper?\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en50" href="part0020.html#ch01en50e">50</a></span> Another insisted that replacing communion wine with grape juice was just as absurd as \xe2\x80\x9csubstitut[ing] sprinkling for baptism\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a violation of <span class="italic">the</span> Baptist distinctive.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en51" href="part0020.html#ch01en51e">51</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Ironically, those who contended most firmly for baptism by immersion also tended to be those who insisted upon replacing wine with grape juice. To hold their view with any consistency, prohibitionists who claimed \xe2\x80\x9cliteralist\xe2\x80\x9d views of the Bible fiercely advocated the two-wine thesis. This theory essentially argued that all the Bible\xe2\x80\x99s positive references to wine were to nonalcoholic juice while all the negative references were to alcoholic wine. Wets like Edward R. Emerson claimed that partaking of wine in communion was \xe2\x80\x9cthe most sacred and solemn act that a human being can perform.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en52" href="part0020.html#ch01en52e">52</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Other Baptist drys, less willing to resort to exegetical gymnastics, took a more \xe2\x80\x9cliberal\xe2\x80\x9d view on Bible wines. This camp included John Broadus, who admitted that all wine in the Bible was alcoholic but used reason and experience to conclude that biblical authors and figures indulged only because doing so was necessary in their culture, but they would never have partaken in modern times, when such beverages were linked with vice. For this reason, and because communion was merely symbolic and using wine would cause total abstainers to stumble in their faith, grape juice could and should be substituted for wine in communion.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en53" href="part0020.html#ch01en53e">53</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">After 1890, the argument over communion wine ceased to occupy much attention of most Southern Baptists, who largely agreed to disagree on the matter. A motion to insist on unfermented grape juice in communion at the 1891 convention of Tennessee Baptists was tabled. Various articles in Baptist journals in 1900 likewise failed to evoke responses or rejoinders. Baptists\xe2\x80\x99 congregational form of government allowed autonomy to local churches and prevented denominational leaders from dictating uniformity. Social sanctions and persuasion turned most Baptist ministers to grape juice in the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Supper by the turn of the century, yet some celebrated their freedom by persisting with wine. Rather than consuming their energy on sacred wine, Baptist leaders instead focused their attention on acting against the liquor business generally.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en54" href="part0020.html#ch01en54e">54</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">African American Baptists also divided on the issue of communion wine and embraced alcohol-free wine more slowly than their white co-religionists. Remarks in the minutes of the National Baptist Convention (NBC), the largest Black denomination (and for a time larger than the SBC), proved that many of its churches continued to use alcoholic wine in communion into the twentieth century. In their 1908 and 1909 reports, the NBC woman\xe2\x80\x99s auxiliary asked for the use of only unfermented wine in communion.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en55" href="part0020.html#ch01en55e">55</a></span> While most white Baptists had by this time either adopted grape juice in communion or made peace with those who persisted with wine, African American Baptists remained divided on communion wine into the twentieth century.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Some Catholics, on the other hand, insisted on Eucharistic wine to <span class="italic">enable</span> alcoholic abstinence. Official records of the Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America (CTAU), founded in 1872, called for abstinence from alcohol, but encouraged regular use of the sacraments\xe2\x80\x94including the wine-bearing Eucharist. J. B. Purcell, the first US bishop personally committed to total alcohol abstinence, emphasized that one could remain abstinent only by \xe2\x80\x9cthe frequent use of the Sacraments,\xe2\x80\x9d and other priests with similar advice appeared frequently in CTAU records.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en56" href="part0020.html#ch01en56e">56</a></span> For Catholics, who believed in transubstantiation, Eucharistic wine was not wine in substance, but transformed into the blood of Christ. For such Catholics, doing away with wine in communion did not help but rather would hinder the cause of abstinence, because the Eucharistic wine was an essential part of their connection with God in Christ, and that connection was necessary for their sobriety.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Columbia University professor John Erskine expressed an objection to nonalcoholic communion wine typical of high-church traditions: if the Eucharist with bread and wine was a central Christian practice, then taking away wine diminished that practice. The essence of Christian faith for Erskine was expressed in the \xe2\x80\x9cbeautiful metaphors\xe2\x80\x9d of Christ from the Gospel of John\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI am the Bread of Life\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI am the true Vine\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and there was no better way to express that truth than in communion with bread and wine.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en57" href="part0020.html#ch01en57e">57</a></span> Erskine claimed that \xe2\x80\x9cprohibition by professed Christians would be impossible if their faith were still warm in the heart or clear in the head, and that it has come now only because that faith is dead.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en58" href="part0020.html#ch01en58e">58</a></span> Ministers, he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cstill read out in the churches that Christ celebrated the Passover with His disciples, with the bread and wine of the ancient sacrifice,\xe2\x80\x9d and he then quoted the related Bible passage.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en59" href="part0020.html#ch01en59e">59</a></span> By objecting \xe2\x80\x9cto the wine as improper, as a temptation and a snare,\xe2\x80\x9d they are \xe2\x80\x9cgiving up, logically if unconsciously, any further concern with the mythical or metaphysical aspects of His nature, or with that inner sustenance of which the bread and wine were to be outward or visible signs.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en60" href="part0020.html#ch01en60e">60</a></span> Such an approach simplifies Christian faith so that \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps nothing will remain of it but an ecclesiastical system or a body of ethical doctrine for such as still revere the life [of Jesus] spent in Galilee.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en61" href="part0020.html#ch01en61e">61</a></span> If the mystical and spiritual union of the believer with Christ in communion was the essence of the Christian faith, then prohibitionists were gutting the heart of Christianity.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">For Erskine, as for Emerson, prohibitionists misinterpreted not only the Bible, but the tradition of the church. Since the catechisms for Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Lutherans, and Catholics alike explicitly mentioned wine as one of the elements to be received in communion, prohibitionists should insist upon reforming their catechisms before supporting prohibition.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en62" href="part0020.html#ch01en62e">62</a></span> Only by divorcing themselves from the traditional teachings of the church could Christians devote themselves so wholeheartedly to the innovation of prohibition. If Christians could select their communion elements at will, Erskine implied, then Christians denied that those elements had any meaning apart from what the church today felt like ascribing to them. Such a faith could pick and choose its practices and doctrines at will. By removing wine from the Eucharist, prohibition proved itself not to be a form of conservative Christianity, but a thoroughly modern innovation. In short, Erskine wondered \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the Eighteenth Amendment [for federal prohibition] is an amendment to the Constitution or to the New Testament.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en63" href="part0020.html#ch01en63e">63</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-a">Christian Liberty</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">On August 15, 1885, a fifty-six-year-old Episcopalian addressed a crowd of thousands in Waco, Texas, on the evils of political preaching.

The target of his ire was the campaign\xe2\x80\x94led by prominent clergy\xe2\x80\x94to dry the area in a local option election, which he claimed would result in a union of church and state. The speaker, Richard Coke, had considerable clout: he was a current US senator, the governor who ended Reconstruction in Texas, and a Confederate veteran who had served on Jefferson Davis\xe2\x80\x99s staff.

Liberty became a rallying cry for anti-prohibitionist Christians in several ways. Anticlericism, or an insistence upon separation between church leaders and the state, predominated among Christians in the South. Also, many Christians had championed liberty as limited government, while drys sought to impose morality by a powerful activist government.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Several historians have traced the dominance of anticlerical views in the South through the nineteenth century. Joe Coker argues that the South initially resisted prohibition in the late nineteenth century because, among other reasons, most southern whites believed in the spirituality of the church.

Notwithstanding southern white evangelical ministers\xe2\x80\x99 support for slavery, secession, the Confederacy, and the Lost Cause before prohibition, the latter issue was instrumental in creating a distinctive form of religious politics of the \xe2\x80\x9cBible Belt,\xe2\x80\x9d which did not exist until the early twentieth century.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en68" href="part0020.html#ch01en68e">68</a></span> Following Locke, Robert Wuthnow briefly contends that prohibition activism was a prominent element in empowering political preaching in the South in the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en69" href="part0020.html#ch01en69e">69</a></span> Coker studied the eastern South (Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama) while Locke and Wuthnow focused on Texas, altogether demonstrating how this religious and political transformation of the South into the Bible Belt occurred across the region around the issue of prohibition.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Episcopalians, the epitome of elite whites in both the South and the North, generally believed that preachers should stay away from politics.

For much of the nineteenth century, many Baptists around the nation, white and Black alike, shared the theological precepts of J. Newton Brown\xe2\x80\x99s 1853 Church Covenant. That covenant was officially endorsed by the Black-led National Baptist Convention (NBC) in 1900, suggesting strong grassroots support for it in the decades leading up to that endorsement. The covenant explicitly called for members \xe2\x80\x9cto abstain from the sale and use of intoxicating drinks as a beverage.\xe2\x80\x9d However, it said nothing about prohibition laws.

As a minority in a democratic society dominated by Protestants, Catholics in the United States generally sought a less intrusive government so they could work out their own salvation. Because Catholic tradition held that alcohol was not inherently sinful, Catholic temperance advocates generally preferred voluntary abstinence out of extraordinary need or piety rather than legal prohibition. Such was the norm in the largest Catholic temperance group in the nation, the Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America (CTAU). Founded in 1872 by clergy from around the nation, the CTAU was both anti-alcohol and anti-prohibition. The opening convention of the CTAU in 1872 issued an \xe2\x80\x9cAddress to the Catholics of America\xe2\x80\x9d insisting upon the motto of \xe2\x80\x9cMoral Suasion\xe2\x80\x9d while shunning \xe2\x80\x9cProhibitory laws, restrictive license systems, and special legislation against drunkenness.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en73" href="part0020.html#ch01en73e">73</a></span> At that same convention, Rev.

Attempting to impose rapid moral development on all people by strict religious laws fit better with the rapidly changing circumstances and evolving theology of American Protestants than with traditionally minded high-church Episcopalians, Lutherans, and Catholics.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en78" href="part0020.html#ch01en78e">78</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">In addition to questioning the politicization of the church for prohibition, many Christian wets in the South believed that dry laws violated their liberty by abandoning the sacrosanct principle of limited government. White southerners throughout the nineteenth century typically held to the Jeffersonian view that divisive moral issues such as alcohol were best left to individuals, families, communities, and local government rather than the state or federal government. This localist critique had roots in the American Revolution and carried weight in the South, which had fought the Civil War to protect their regional practice of slavery and long after the war invoked the rights of each state and locale to settle contentious moral issues.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The notion of limited government also had roots in classical Christian theology, which taught that individuals built righteous character by overcoming temptation through self-control, Christian community, and divine assistance. This traditional Christian position opposed prohibition, which attempted to use the state to prevent sin by removing temptation. Rather than merely exhorting parishioners to overcome bondage to drunkenness by moderate drinking or voluntary abstention, dry ministers saw demon rum as inexorable, requiring not merely individual willpower or church support but state intervention. For prohibitionists, the locus of godly social reform thus shifted from the church to the state, with the church playing a secondary role as a pressure group to ensure the progressive advancement of human morality\xe2\x80\x94not through the regeneration of souls by the power of the Holy Spirit but the coercion of bodies by the power of government. By replacing the roles of God and the church with the state, prohibition made government control all-important, turned the issue into a holy culture war that justified almost any means to achieve its end, and effectively secularized the church\xe2\x80\x99s function while attempting to sacralize the state.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s rise prompted church leaders to clamp down on dissident voices and enforce ideological uniformity on a political issue. This happened not only among Methodists, who already had a top-down structure, but increasingly among liberty-loving Baptists, who celebrated congregational autonomy and soul liberty to follow one\xe2\x80\x99s individual conscience on secondary matters. Even Baptists, who in colonial Virginia had sometimes been imprisoned for defying the Anglican establishment, sought to impose their own moral vision on the South a century later as they gained cultural and political power.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">By the 1870s, some Southern Baptists began advocating prohibition, yet they were out of step with most Baptists and Christian tradition. Baptists generally agreed that wine was permitted in the Bible and even consumed by Jesus, yet dry Baptists primarily relied on arguments from common-sense reasoning and contemporary experience. In 1875, the Baptist State Convention of Texas\xe2\x80\x99s Committee on Temperance cataloged the evils of the liquor traffic: it wasted $900 million and murdered more than sixty thousand people annually; it generated 75 percent of crime and most of the poverty and insanity; and was \xe2\x80\x9ccorrupting the ballot box,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chastening monopoly,\xe2\x80\x9d and even \xe2\x80\x9cplanting the seeds of communism.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en79" href="part0020.html#ch01en79e">79</a></span> These concerns were all contemporary and contingent\xe2\x80\x94particularly matters such as elections, monopolies, and communism\xe2\x80\x94rather than being based on eternal values from Scripture or tradition. Still, many Southern Baptists then favored moderate drinking, believed only the Gospel could cure a drunkard, and shunned politically lobbying for prohibition. Southern Methodists in the mid-1870s likewise focused more on strict abstinence among their members than in passing prohibition laws.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">White Baptist preachers defended prohibition advocacy as their Christian duty to resist evil. Responding directly to Senator Coke\xe2\x80\x99s call to put political preachers in their place, the \xe2\x80\x9cold time Baptist\xe2\x80\x9d preacher I. B. Kimbrough pronounced in 1887 at the Baptist State Convention that he would rather \xe2\x80\x9clive on corn cobs and stump water\xe2\x80\x9d than \xe2\x80\x9callow any politician to put a padlock on my mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en80" href="part0020.html#ch01en80e">80</a></span> The language inverted the wet rhetoric against political preachers as power-hungry and gave them the moral high ground as saints suffering for freedom of speech. While southern clergy asserted regional distinctiveness, their dry campaign also tied them into a national movement to advance Christian values.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The issue of prohibition also led Baptist churches to modify their traditional emphasis on congregational autonomy. Though state conventions of the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) had never before exercised authority over local congregations, according to historian Rufus Spain, various state conventions in the 1870s began threatening to cut off churches who did not properly discipline their members to avoid involvement in the alcohol trade. While Baptist churches had long since punished saloon operators and drunkards, Baptist churches began using social sanctions against those involved in the alcohol industry more generally: brewers, distillers, liquor wholesalers, or even property owners who rented land to them. Florida passed such a resolution in 1872, followed by Georgia in 1873, Texas in 1876, and Mississippi in 1878. While churches or individuals could flout them, such resolutions had an overall chilling effect on those involved in the alcohol trade. Still, in the 1870s, these were just several states in the SBC, not the whole denomination.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The turning point for white Methodists and Baptists across the South on prohibition was 1886. That year, the Methodist General Conference (Southern Methodists) denounced the manufacture and sale of alcoholic drinks as sins. After that, the denomination plunged into prohibition advocacy even as they continued using moral suasion within their churches.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en81" href="part0020.html#ch01en81e">81</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">While the Methodist hierarchy backed prohibition, some lay Methodists opposed it. Roger Quarles Mills, a Methodist from Corsicana, had been an ardent prohibitionist with his own dry monthly paper, <span class="italic">Prairie Blade.</span> One 1855 issue compared the argument that liquor is good because it brings in tax revenue to the argument that \xe2\x80\x9ca maiden should sell her virtue or a man his honesty for gold or silver.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en82" href="part0020.html#ch01en82e">82</a></span> Yet by 1887, Mills, a former US representative and future US senator, had joined the wet \xe2\x80\x9cTrue Blues,\xe2\x80\x9d contending that legal prohibition undermined Jeffersonian democracy. Mills withdrew from the Southern Methodist denomination to protest constant \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical preaching,\xe2\x80\x9d and in a debate with B. H. Carroll retorted, \xe2\x80\x9cHell is full of better preachers than that man, so full that their legs are hanging out at the windows.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en83" href="part0020.html#ch01en83e">83</a></span> While some Methodist laymen were convicted by their preachers to vote dry, others grew alienated and left because of the political preaching.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">As with Methodists, the SBC\xe2\x80\x99s first temperance resolution in 1886 was a sea change. Support for local option laws slowly morphed into support for statewide and national prohibition by the 1890s. Nonetheless, Southern Baptists did not see temperance as all-important: most denounced the Prohibition Party for undermining white supremacy by threatening the Democratic Party\xe2\x80\x99s stranglehold on the region.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en84" href="part0020.html#ch01en84e">84</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The endorsement of legal prohibition among Baptists represented a decisive shift from church-led moral suasion to state-enforced laws. As the Texas Baptists\xe2\x80\x99 Temperance Report from 1886 stated, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98moral suasion\xe2\x80\x99 has been rung in our ears so long by those who never did anything <span class="italic">for</span> moral suasion\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis original) that it \xe2\x80\x9chas ceased to be potent.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en85" href="part0020.html#ch01en85e">85</a></span> The report also noted that the government had never enforced local prohibition laws and saloon operators often flouted them\xe2\x80\x94a curious argument to lobby for <span class="italic">more</span> laws. Baptists must \xe2\x80\x9cas citizens <span class="small-caps2">VOTE</span> against this hydra-headed monster,\xe2\x80\x9d since \xe2\x80\x9cit is our duty as Christians to vote for prohibition\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfor God, and home, and native land\xe2\x80\x9d (the motto of the WCTU). If dry activism should lead to a backlash, the committee urged, \xe2\x80\x9clet us force the boycott.\xe2\x80\x9d The report then invoked Psalm 2 (\xe2\x80\x9clet the heathen rage\xe2\x80\x9d) and the Declaration of Independence (\xe2\x80\x9clet us pledge our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor\xe2\x80\x9d) to inspire their comrades against \xe2\x80\x9cthis greatest of all iniquities\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94alcohol. Texas Baptists adopted the whole report, indicating that the time for old-fashioned moral suasion was over.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en86" href="part0020.html#ch01en86e">86</a></span> Their American experience and identity had redefined the very meaning of Christian liberty.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Then in 1896, the SBC itself issued a resolution that not only endorsed prohibition, but also promised action against any Baptist who did any business with the liquor traffic. The resolution read:</p>\n<p class="x-ex-np">We announce it as the sense of this body that no person should be retained in the fellowship of a Baptist church who engages in the manufacture or sale of alcoholic liquors, either at wholesale or retail, who invests his money in the manufacture or sale of alcoholic liquors, or who rents his property to be used for distilleries, wholesale liquor houses or saloon. Nor do we believe that any church should retain in its fellowship any member who drinks intoxicating liquors as a beverage, or visits saloons or drinking places for the purpose of such indulgence.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Though the SBC had no mechanism to enforce compliance, the power of state conventions could bar individual churches from their fellowship. By 1900, every Southern Baptist state convention save North Carolina had passed similar resolutions, which pressured their churches to comply. With these declarations, prohibition advocacy became a defining issue of Southern Baptist identity. It seems fitting that the main nineteenth-century social issue on which Southern Baptists demanded new government regulations also led state conventions to exert more direct control over churches. Baptists\xe2\x80\x99 increasing advocacy for alcohol prohibition by law paralleled their diminishing tolerance of dissenting views on alcohol in church government.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en87" href="part0020.html#ch01en87e">87</a></span> Rather than pursuing anticlerical politics and limited government, white evangelicals in the South reinterpreted temperance to mean a total war against alcohol that demanded its unconditional surrender through state-mandated prohibition.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">While more traditionalist Christians favored working out their salvation apart from state interference, prohibitionists insisted that an enlarged government played a necessary part in attaining salvation from demon rum. Scholars like Richard Hamm, Ann-Marie Szymanski, and Lisa McGirr have made clear how prohibitionists contributed to the development of a more powerful federal government.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en88" href="part0020.html#ch01en88e">88</a></span> Prohibition also profoundly changed the South\xe2\x80\x99s perception of progressive, interventionist government on the state level. Despite the South\xe2\x80\x99s reputation for Jeffersonian Democracy and local rule, various scholars have pointed out how prohibition in the South was profoundly linked to the progressive movement and trademark streamlining of government. As Szymanski observed, the South grew more progressive through embracing prohibition, but she rejects the claim that the South\xe2\x80\x99s turn to progressivism came from chiefly northern influence, as William A. Link, Paul L. Harvey, and others have contended. Instead, she argues persuasively that southern progressives\xe2\x80\x99 approach to prohibition by gradual measures and local option often were more effective than more sudden and statewide approaches popular in the North. As a result, prohibition laws lasted much longer in the South than the rest of the nation. Whether or not progressivism in the South was mostly indigenous or imported, it was profoundly linked to radical changes in how southerners looked to government, from child labor laws to taxation reform. Thomas R. Pegram sums up a consensus among prohibition scholars by putting the reform at the forefront of a dramatic change for the Jeffersonian South: \xe2\x80\x9c[P]rohibition was a doorway to a host of reforms that entailed expanded state regulation over personal liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en89" href="part0020.html#ch01en89e">89</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-a">Conclusion</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Traditional Christian views on temperance, the Bible, communion wine, and liberty all resisted the American innovation of alcohol prohibition. Despite citing Scripture to suit their own purposes, drys broke with classical morality, the example of Jesus, Christian ceremonies, and American traditions to advance their novel Gospel of prohibition. The truly traditionalist Christians were not drys, but wets.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The communion wine question still divides Christians today. Millions every Sunday imbibe grape juice at communion without considering how truly modern that drink is. Given the fierce debates within Baptist and Methodist churches over the issue, it is remarkable that during national prohibition neither federal nor state governments sought to prevent the production or consumption of sacred wine. It remains an open question how much of their Christian past prohibitionists left behind when they chose the cup of Dr. Welch over the cup of their spiritual forebears.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Decades after the Civil War resolved the theological and political crisis of slavery, Christians who read the same Bible and prayed to the same God continued to deploy theology and Scripture on both sides of a culture war, this time over prohibition. White evangelical drys continued to approach the Bible the same way most US citizens did up to the Civil War: with an individualist, republican, common-sense hermeneutic. This hermeneutic democratized the interpretation of the Bible and gave readers a sense of the certainty of their readings directly with the text apart from the traditional teachings and practices of the church.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch01en90" href="part0020.html#ch01en90e">90</a></span> Many today still invoke Christian faith for contemporary politics, and then as now, they do so on both sides of the culture wars.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Having taken a stance against Christian tradition for prohibition, white evangelical drys throughout the South took the political offensive in the 1880s, testing their political strength for the first time through a series of statewide and local prohibition campaigns. These referenda challenged southern traditions in three other areas: race, gender, and party unity. While drys\xe2\x80\x99 early efforts to dry up the Bourbon South mostly failed, they began a movement that challenged the region\xe2\x80\x99s norms and would eventually transform it into the Bible Belt.</p>\n</body></html>\n'</p>

The name \xe2\x80\x9cBourbon\xe2\x80\x9d also had connections to the Marquis de Lafayette, who was descended from that line, thus linking the American Bourbons to the early independence period and Lafayette\xe2\x80\x99s friend Thomas Jefferson. In some states, such as Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s home state of Virginia, the ruling party preferred to call itself \xe2\x80\x9cConservative\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cDemocrat\xe2\x80\x9d for some years after Reconstruction. These Bourbons saw themselves as the defenders of the South\xe2\x80\x99s traditions against the radical reforms of Republican Reconstruction. And one of those traditions the Bourbons defended was the production, sale, and consumption of alcoholic beverages, including the native southern drink, bourbon.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">First crafted in Virginia (later eastern Kentucky) in the late-eighteenth century, bourbon whiskey is corn-based and aged in charred oak casks, giving it a distinctive taste and reddish color.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="part01en1" href="part0020.html#part01en1e">1</a></span> The drink likely took its name from its birthplace, Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s capacious Bourbon County, which was subsequently broken up into over a dozen counties after Kentucky became a state in 1792. Part of that region became Kentucky\xe2\x80\x99s Bourbon County, which hosted many bourbon distilleries as early as 1785, further cementing the connection between the name and the drink. The product grew in quality and popularity over the years, and the name \xe2\x80\x9cbourbon\xe2\x80\x9d became widespread by the 1840s to distinguish it from other forms of whiskey. European distillers and vintners in 1960 gave American bourbon a special status reserved for other national beverages such as Scotch whiskey and French cognac. Congress declared bourbon a \xe2\x80\x9cdistinctive product of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d in 1964 and clarified that, among other rules, true bourbon must be crafted in the United States. The Kentucky Bourbon Trail, officially established in 1999, attracts over a million visitors annually to enjoy this national treasure in its natural habitat.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="part01en2" href="part0020.html#part01en2e">2</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">This happy overlap between the conservative Bourbon Democrats and the South\xe2\x80\x99s distinctive drink did not begin or end with a naming coincidence. Opposition to alcohol prohibition in the South in the late-nineteenth century was conservative in every sense of the word because prohibition threatened the existing social, political, and theological order. Theologically, traditionalist Christians opposed prohibition for its challenge to older ideas about temperance, the Bible, communion wine, and liberty. Politically and socially, some prohibitionists proposed radical changes from giving women the right to vote to promoting potent multiracial political coalitions for statewide elections in the 1880s, just a few short years after Bourbons had tried to eliminate African Americans as a force in southern politics. While the South in the early twentieth century would become a dry citadel, in the late-nineteenth century it was, in every sense, under Bourbon rule.</p>\n</body></html>\n'</p>

In that era, pastors often denounced the alcohol traffic for spawning crime, economic waste, political corruption, women\xe2\x80\x99s degradation, moral degeneration, and countless ailments. Brewers were, in a word, evil. For decades before and after that 1912 letter, the United States endured a culture war over prohibition\xe2\x80\x94the legal ban on the manufacture, transportation, and sale of alcohol. The drama played out in churches, legislatures, courthouses, alleyways, prisons, and voting booths. Prohibitionist \xe2\x80\x9cdrys\xe2\x80\x9d battled anti-prohibition \xe2\x80\x9cwets,\xe2\x80\x9d legitimized political preaching, and, from January 1920 to December 1933, banned the alcohol traffic throughout the United States. The nation\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful dry organization, the Anti-Saloon League (ASL), was organized by a Congregational minister and used the motto: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Church in Action Against the Saloon.\xe2\x80\x9d God, it seemed, was on the side of the drys.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">But that July 1912 letter told a very different story. For one thing, its author was John B. Rayner, a political organizer who had been the most famous African American in the Populist Party. For another, he did not object to the brewers\xe2\x80\x99 business. Indeed, he had spent much of the past seven years campaigning against prohibition. He just wanted to be paid.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The payment he demanded was not unearned or unreasonable; it was back pay for his invaluable political services over the past seven years that had helped keep the brewers\xe2\x80\x99 business legal. Rayner claimed to have tipped the balance in twenty \xe2\x80\x9clocal option\xe2\x80\x9d contests\xe2\x80\x94votes to ban or legalize alcohol in towns, cities, or counties\xe2\x80\x94and mobilized thousands of Black farmers, whose votes had averted statewide prohibition in 1911. In an earlier letter, he claimed to have mobilized tens of thousands of Black voters. He used \xe2\x80\x9cMachiavellian diplomacy\xe2\x80\x9d in African American \xe2\x80\x9creligious, educational and business gatherings,\xe2\x80\x9d employing know-how from his days as a Populist Party boss. In short, he was a \xe2\x80\x9cprotagonist\xe2\x80\x9d against prohibition who did more for anti-prohibition \xe2\x80\x9cthan all the other [African Americans] combined.\xe2\x80\x9d Rayner claimed not to have profited personally from this but rather sold or mortgaged his best properties for the cause, while brewers prospered.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en1" href="part0020.html#ch00en1e">1</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">What would compel a Christian minister to endure such suffering for an industry so disreputable that most Protestant churches advocated its abolition? Rayner claimed that he did it because \xe2\x80\x9cthe liberty of man is in danger.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en2" href="part0020.html#ch00en2e">2</a></span> For many believers, then as now, Christian liberty meant more than abstract forgiveness of sins and hope for the hereafter; it meant freedom in the here and now. Christian wets used the language of Christian liberty to preach against prohibition, and this took on a special significance in the Black church. At that time, African Americans were losing civil liberties far more pressing than the freedom to drink. Under Jim Crow, millions of Black Americans across the South lost their right to vote. Restrictive voting laws such as poll taxes had virtually eliminated African American influence over statewide elected office in the region by 1902. Nonetheless, many Black citizens across the South could still vote\xe2\x80\x94if they could afford poll taxes. African Americans whose faith compelled them to vote found supporters in the alcohol lobby: a wealthy, white-owned industry willing to do anything to secure votes. It seemed a match made in heaven.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">This is not just a story of John Rayner or of African American Christians working with brewers. It is not even just a history of anti-prohibition in the South. Rather, this book offers a religious and racial history of prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s rise and fall in the US South from 1885 to 1935. Race (particularly white and Black) and religion (particularly Christianity) are two areas in which prohibition wrought profound changes to the cultural landscape of the South and the whole nation. While some aspects of the connections between prohibition, race, and religion have received scholarly attention, other aspects have remained understudied. The book gives as much distinct emphasis to prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s relationship to Christianity as to its relationship to race, and it focuses as much on the anti-prohibition movement as on prohibitionists.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Approach and Sources</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">While the book moves between emphases on race and religion for the sake of analytical clarity, it sees the two as parts of a seamless cultural whole. As Kristin Kobes Du Mez argues in <span class="italic">Jesus and John Wayne,</span> a supposedly theological category such as \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98conservative evangelical\xe2\x80\x99 is as much about culture as it is about theology\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and the culture she focuses on concerns constructions of gender, politics, and race.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en3" href="part0020.html#ch00en3e">3</a></span> While Du Mez\xe2\x80\x99s book focuses on white evangelicals since 1945, her statement also resonates with \xe2\x80\x9clived religion\xe2\x80\x9d approaches to ethno-religious communities from New England Puritans to present-day charismatics.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en4" href="part0020.html#ch00en4e">4</a></span> Viewing prohibition through the twin lenses of race and religion enables in-depth attention to how stray strands of theology and minority figures ordinarily overlooked in prohibition studies might cast the overall picture in a new light.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">This study arrives at these findings by heeding quieter or unheard voices and by noting absences of language just as much as their presence. African American and more traditionalist churches have received less attention on prohibition (and other culture-war issues) than white evangelicals, yet some searching reveals that the former groups played major roles in the contest. Though most wets did not scream their religious credentials as loudly as most drys did, close analysis of theological and ritual details reveals convictions that informed the wet stance of millions of southern voters. Indeed, the toning down of religious and racial rhetoric in the 1930s was itself a major development in the prohibition debate, signaling a significant break from past activism. Approaching religious practice as always potentially interacting with politics and cultural issues such as race, even when religious rhetoric is not obviously linked to activism, helps uncover the subtle\xe2\x80\x94and therefore understudied\xe2\x80\x94connections between faith and politics.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en5" href="part0020.html#ch00en5e">5</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">This study employs a wide array of primary sources, including election data, secular and religious newspapers, denominational minutes, speeches, correspondence, and contemporary publications. Archives from Texas to Tennessee and abundant digitized sources were invaluable for this research. It is unfortunate that, even in the best archives, African American denominational sources are generally less complete than comparable white sources, but enough sources have survived to give a decent impression of the debates over prohibition in Black churches. Speeches from white evangelical wets and surviving correspondence from brewers (thanks to the vigorous investigations of Texas\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general, B. F. Looney) provided priceless insights as well. This book\xe2\x80\x99s main contribution, however, is not so much uncovering new sources as viewing widely available evidence through the twin lenses of religion and race. In both areas, prohibition and anti-prohibition reshaped the order of southern society and politics.</p>\n<p class="x-a">(Anti-)Prohibition and Race</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Viewing prohibition through the lens of race clarifies larger political trends in the South, particularly around the term \xe2\x80\x9cGin Crow.\xe2\x80\x9d Gin Crow is peculiar phrase which, as far as this author knows, is unique to this book, and it asserts that prohibition in the US South was closely linked to Jim Crow, an array of measures that aimed to secure white supremacy through racial segregation and the suppression of Black votes. The links between prohibition and Jim Crow that constitute Gin Crow can be divided into four broad categories: chronology, white dry support, Black resistance, and racial enforcement. First, chronologically, statewide prohibition existed in the South only during Jim Crow (except in Mississippi, which remained nominally dry into the 1960s).</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Second, white drys transitioned their tactics from openly seeking interracial coalitions in the 1880s to seeking victory through suppressing Black votes and converting white votes. White drys believed it was the only reliable path to prohibition in the region. As Ann-Marie Szymanski observed, \xe2\x80\x9cdisfranchisement of blacks principally enhanced the opportunities for dry success by eliminating one of the leading rationales for Democratic unity in the South\xe2\x80\x9d: namely, white-only control of political power.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en6" href="part0020.html#ch00en6e">6</a></span> Howard Rabinowitz and Richard Hamm likewise contend that African Americans\xe2\x80\x99 tendency to vote against prohibition, especially in close elections, was a major argument for their disfranchisement, which in turn helped prohibition succeed in the South.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en7" href="part0020.html#ch00en7e">7</a></span> Some of the most prominent drys in the South\xe2\x80\x94including \xe2\x80\x9cFather of American Prohibition\xe2\x80\x9d Richmond Pearson Hobson, prohibition \xe2\x80\x9cmartyr\xe2\x80\x9d Edward Ward Carmack, Methodist Bishop James Cannon, and Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard Hiram Wesley Evans\xe2\x80\x94were also notorious white supremacists who deployed racist rhetoric to advance their dry cause. In short, white drys supported Jim Crow, which in turn enabled prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s success.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Discussions of race, religion, and alcohol in the South cannot be separated from discussions of gender. As Joe Coker argues, racial hierarchy, honor, and gender roles were essential components in prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s rise in the South.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en8" href="part0020.html#ch00en8e">8</a></span> One obvious example of those three value sets coming together for prohibition was the specter of a drunken Black man attacking a white woman. This racist trope, the worn excuse for lynchings and all manner of white-supremacist violence, was also a piece of white dry propaganda in the South. If alcohol in the hands of Black men symbolized a vital threat to the racial and gendered order, then abolishing that threat by law became an imperative. In fact, some drys urged prohibition so that lynchings could be avoided: without demon rum, docility would replace danger, and all would be well. The exaggerated fear of disorderly Black men assaulting white women loomed large in the imagination of honor-bound white southerners and played no small role in prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s rise in the region. By their rhetoric and actions, prominent white drys advanced and upheld the racial hierarchy of Jim Crow.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Third, due to this dynamic, African American participation in local and statewide prohibition elections in the 1900s and 1910s effectively became a form of resistance to Jim Crow. Though Jim Crow laws depressed Black voter turnout immediately, thousands of African Americans continued to decide prohibition elections at the local and state levels into the 1910s in defiance of laws that attempted to erase their political influence. Admittedly, Black resistance to Gin Crow was circumscribed. Jim Crow laws had disfranchised most\xe2\x80\x94though not all\xe2\x80\x94African Americans by the first decade of the twentieth century, and white Democrats exercised a stranglehold on statewide offices and state legislatures throughout the region. African American voters responded by overwhelmingly backing the brewers, who were desperate enough to do anything, even undermining Jim Crow, to stay in business. White supremacists in the wet coalition unwittingly helped to prop up interracial politics by protecting the alcohol lobby, which was the most powerful white industry to mobilize Black voters and to subvert Jim Crow poll taxes. To oppose Gin Crow (southern prohibition) in the 1910s was to oppose Jim Crow, and that opposition was stronger and went longer than scholars have previously thought possible.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en9" href="part0020.html#ch00en9e">9</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Scholars have not realized how much Black votes mattered in prohibition contests in the 1910s. African Americans decided countless local option elections and even several statewide elections across the South as late as 1910 (Florida), 1911 (Texas), and 1912 (Arkansas). Sociologist Ann-Marie Szymanski claims that African Americans\xe2\x80\x99 impact on prohibition elections in the South is difficult to verify, since drys lost those statewide referenda \xe2\x80\x9cdespite the diminished voting power of southern blacks.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en10" href="part0020.html#ch00en10e">10</a></span> However, that same evidence could also suggest that wets won in those states precisely because African Americans continued to vote despite restrictive voting laws. Wets won those election precisely because of Black voters, not despite their absence.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Perhaps scholars have overlooked African American voters of the 1910s because prohibition had so thoroughly devastated Black voting by 1920. Just as disfranchising Black voters helped dry up the South, so also the imposition of prohibition, by removing the political protection of the alcohol lobby, finally silenced mass Black voting across the South. Statewide prohibition across the South in the mid-to-late 1910s accomplished what Jim Crow laws on their own failed to do: end meaningful and mass voting for Black southerners.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Fourth, during prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s regime, racial minorities were disproportionately arrested and punished for violations of drug laws. White drys were concerned not only with containing Black votes but also with controlling Black bodies. Aaron Griffith has observed that, \xe2\x80\x9cThroughout the nation\xe2\x80\x99s history, race has been a crucial backdrop for American thinking and policymaking on criminal justice,\xe2\x80\x9d and this is no less true on prohibition enforcement.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en11" href="part0020.html#ch00en11e">11</a></span> As Michelle Alexander has demonstrated, mass incarceration has been and continues to be one of the major drivers of systemic racial inequality. Lisa McGirr likewise argues that, just as racial minorities face higher arrest rates, higher conviction rates, and more time served than whites in the latter-day War on Drugs, so it was a century ago in the War on Alcohol. Then as now, unequal enforcement of drug laws provided a useful tool for whites to control Black souls. If opposition to the War on Drugs today constitutes opposition to the \xe2\x80\x9cNew Jim Crow,\xe2\x80\x9d opposition to prohibition then constituted opposition to the old Jim Crow.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en12" href="part0020.html#ch00en12e">12</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">In short, prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s timing, implementation, resistance, and enforcement made it an integral part of Jim Crow, such that those who resisted prohibition in the South were effectively defying Gin Crow, whether or not they did so intentionally. Even when white wet Christians did not explicitly oppose Jim Crow, their anti-prohibition activism in the 1900s and 1910s effectively prolonged African American suffrage and thus delayed complete racial disfranchisement in the region.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The racial story of Gin Crow does not stop in 1920, however, but continued until its repeal in the 1930s. As Barry Hankins correctly notes, African Americans \xe2\x80\x9cplayed almost no part\xe2\x80\x9d in prohibition contests in the 1920s because they \xe2\x80\x9cwere not allowed to participate\xe2\x80\x9d in what had become a \xe2\x80\x9cwhite culture war.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en13" href="part0020.html#ch00en13e">13</a></span> However, white drys continued to invoke racial fears against the wet presidential candidate in 1928, once again linking Gin Crow to white supremacism. Then in 1932, white southerners worried less about the Democratic presidential nominee\xe2\x80\x99s wet stance than white unity, especially after the Republican White House had transgressed white southern racial and gender lines by treating an African American congressman\xe2\x80\x99s wife as an equal to white women. The relative absence of racial language during the repeal debates of the 1930s compared with the prohibition debates of the 1910s demonstrates how much prohibition had affected and been affected by racial politics in the South over just a few years.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The rise of white women in southern politics from the 1910s to the 1930s corresponded to the political decline of African Americans. The language of cleaning up politics though prohibition and (white) women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage together took on explicitly racial dimensions in the South. Particularly after drys suffered narrow losses in statewide elections across the South in the 1910s, white drys increasingly complained that Black (and in Texas, Mexican) men could vote against prohibition while white women could not vote for it. The wet coalition in the 1930s South had virtually no African Americans, but it grew to include prominent white women, including state legislators and a governor. The move of respectable white women into wet ranks signaled another shift: women\xe2\x80\x99s support gave wets the moral high ground previously held by drys, in part because white women did not feel they needed prohibition anymore to protect them from Black men. While Jim Crow remained for decades more, Gin Crow died in part because it was no longer needed to maintain the racial order.</p>\n<p class="x-a">(Anti-)Prohibition and Christianity</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Prohibition also reshaped southern Christianity in four major ways. First, before dry agitation gained supremacy in the early twentieth century, most southerners stood with millennia of Christian tradition, which had blessed moderate consumption of fermented drinks at home and in the sacred act of communion. Many Christian southerners loudly objected to prohibition as an alien innovation in theology and polity. To justify their political reform, drys first reshaped communion, denominations, and Bible interpretation to fit with their common-sense objections to alcohol, then deployed a combination of righteous indignation, racial invective, and modern organization to implement their political vision. Many scholars have noted that prohibition was politically progressive, but few have observed how deeply it transgressed the theological orthodoxies of the South.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en14" href="part0020.html#ch00en14e">14</a></span> The political revolution of prohibition was necessarily preceded by a religious one.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Second, religion played a major role on both sides in the culture war before prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s zenith, and this book pays particular attention to the neglected role of Christian rhetoric for wets. Joseph Locke and other scholars have noted how drys mainstreamed political preaching in the South and so created the Bible Belt, but none have paid comparable attention to how wets also deployed boldly religious rhetoric.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en15" href="part0020.html#ch00en15e">15</a></span> The contest over prohibition in the South included multiple Christian identities and theologies competing for social dominance. Christian wets ranged from Episcopalian bishops and Catholic priests to Black Baptist ministers and lay white Southern Methodists. Some wets claimed that prohibition was irreconcilable with traditional Christian teachings on morality, liberty, moderate alcohol use, and communion wine. Before drys could argue against alcohol in general, they had to abolish ritual communion wine in their churches, demonstrating how their political views led them to dispense with or modernize ancient Christian rites. Even some white evangelicals, usually lay politicians, objected to prohibition on carefully reasoned Christian tradition and the Bible, revealing a divide between pulpit and pew even in supposedly bone-dry denominations. The South\xe2\x80\x99s religious-political scene, at least before 1920, was rich in complexity. A South that largely condemned dry ministers\xe2\x80\x99 political preaching in the 1880s had by the 1920s embraced it, and prohibition had opened the door to Christianity playing explicitly on <span class="italic">both</span> sides of culture wars. As some drys wryly noted, wets may have objected to political preaching when drys did it, but they did not mind political preaching when it was on <span class="italic">their</span> side.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en16" href="part0020.html#ch00en16e">16</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Third, the prohibition movement in the South started off as somewhat religiously ecumenical but ended up fueling anti-Catholic bigotry. While some northern Republicans labeled Democrats the party of \xe2\x80\x9crum, Romanism, and rebellion\xe2\x80\x9d in 1884, southern drys from the 1880s to the 1910s attempted to win over Catholics, and a few prominent Catholics such as Archbishop John Ireland supported prohibition. When prohibition became the law in the late 1910s, however, the religious calculus shifted. The only US governor ever elected under the Prohibition Party banner, Sidney Johnston Catts of Florida, rode into office in 1917 on a wave of anti-Catholic bigotry. The second iteration of the Ku Klux Klan embodied racial and religious prejudice in the 1910s and 1920s, and as Lisa McGirr has noted, prohibition \xe2\x80\x9cenabled the Klan\xe2\x80\x99s rise to power.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en17" href="part0020.html#ch00en17e">17</a></span> The presidential election of 1928 raised anti-Catholicism to a fever pitch as the Democratic nominee, Al Smith, was a wet Catholic. Prominent southern Protestants from the progressive Southern Methodist James Cannon in Virginia to the Fundamentalist Baptist J. Frank Norris in Texas led an insurrection against the Democratic Party\xe2\x80\x99s nominee and shattered the \xe2\x80\x9cSolid South\xe2\x80\x9d with a seamless blend of dry and anti-Catholic rhetoric.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Fourth, the effort to repeal prohibition in the South in the 1930s signaled a retreat from the vigorous political preaching of the 1910s and 1920s toward more secular rhetoric. Just as racial language cooled from the election of 1928, so also did stridently religious language, or at least such language was mostly on the losing side. The election of 1928 had bitterly divided the South\xe2\x80\x99s solidly Democratic white electorate with political preaching, yet the elections of 1930 and 1932 reunified white Protestant Democrats and punished politicians who had strayed from the party fold. The Democratic presidential nominee in 1932 was another wet New Yorker, but this time he was safely Protestant. Unity around this Protestant candidate ironically weakened the sway of white Baptist and Methodist political preachers who insisted that prohibition was the single issue to unite all Christian voters.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Preachers may have lost political sway in the Great Depression as many sought salvation through the ecumenical New Deal, but women\xe2\x80\x99s political clout had never been stronger. Many southern women led the charge for repeal with less distinctively Christian rhetoric than the Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). While prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s marginalization of nonwhites in the South persisted for decades after repeal, some non-Protestants, particularly white Catholics, politically rose in the region after the nadir of 1928, with some Catholic women serving prominent roles in repeal organizations.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Some scholars have interpreted the repeal of prohibition as the death knell for white Protestant cultural ascendency in the United States, yet in the South it was more of a tactical retreat that foreshadowed a later return.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en18" href="part0020.html#ch00en18e">18</a></span> By pushing the religious narrative past the usual cutoff date of 1920, when prohibition seemed victorious, this trend becomes clear. While political preaching by clergy and laity alike would rise again in the South, ranging from anti\xe2\x80\x93New Deal conservative evangelicals to African Americans in the civil rights movement, its moment would have to wait.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en19" href="part0020.html#ch00en19e">19</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-a">Organization</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">The book proceeds more or less chronologically. Each chapter touches on both race and religion, though some focus more on one or the other. Part I, \xe2\x80\x9cBourbon Rule,\xe2\x80\x9d considers the difficulty of prohibition taking root in the South in the nineteenth century. Most southerners, white and Black alike, embraced a moderate stance on alcohol based on traditional Christian theology and practice, from interpretations of Bible passages to communion wine, so drys were fighting against the cultural and religious current. Chapter 2 explores the interracial politics of prohibition campaigns of the 1880s in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and Texas. While white fears and Black doubts undermined attempts at multiracial dry coalitions, the fact that such attempts occurred at all demonstrates the fluidity of race relations in the pre\xe2\x80\x93Jim Crow period.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Part 2, \xe2\x80\x9cGin Crow,\xe2\x80\x9d considers the rise and fall of statewide and federal prohibition in the region in light of race and religion. Southern white backlash to the apparent failure of interracial politics in the 1880s\xe2\x80\x94along with reaction to the multiracial populist movement\xe2\x80\x94led white drys to favor Jim Crow laws and suppress Black votes. Prohibition in the South, which had once been associated with multiracial coalitions, became intertwined with white-supremacist laws and law enforcement.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Yet many Black and white Christians resisted this new dry order in the 1900s and 1910s. Clergy and laity alike deployed traditional Christian arguments about temperance, the Bible, and liberty against prohibition. African Americans, using networks that included Black churches, allied with brewers to speak out, organize, and cast decisive votes against local option and statewide prohibition referenda from one end of the South to the other. After prohibition triumphed on the state and national levels, enforcement of prohibition disproportionately targeted racial and ethnic minorities, legitimated political preaching by white culture warriors, and emboldened white-supremacist and anti-Catholic politics from the second Ku Klux Klan to the anti\xe2\x80\x93Al Smith movement in 1928.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The final chapter details how the repeal of prohibition in the South was \xe2\x80\x9clily-white\xe2\x80\x9d: white women played decisive roles in repeal, but African Americans were not empowered by the demise of Gin Crow in the 1930s as they had been by resistance to its rise in the 1910s. Also, the repeal effort appealed far less explicitly to race or religion than either wets or drys had in the days before statewide and federal prohibition, indicating broader ebbs and flows in the region\xe2\x80\x99s relationship between race, religion, and politics. A brief epilogue sketches subsequent development in alcohol regulation, religiously infused politics, and the re-empowerment of racial and religious minorities across the South.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Terms</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">More clarification of terms is in order. Prohibition is distinct from yet produced by the temperance movement founded in the 1820s. Some temperance advocates avoided only distilled drinks and used lighter fermented drinks, while others believed only capital-T Total abstinence from alcohol (teetotalism) would do. Another divide formed between those who focused on moral suasion and those who promoted legal bans on alcohol (prohibition). Though prohibitionists often conflated their cause with \xe2\x80\x9ctemperance,\xe2\x80\x9d others also clung to that title. Some historians use capitalized \xe2\x80\x9cProhibition\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to federal prohibition through the Eighteenth Amendment, enforced from 1920 to 1933. Since state and local prohibition laws existed long before and\xe2\x80\x94especially in the South\xe2\x80\x94long after federal prohibition, this book prefers lowercase \xe2\x80\x9cprohibition,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning any law at the local, state, or federal level forbidding the sale of all alcoholic beverages with few exceptions (such as medical and sacramental purposes).</p>\n<p class="x-txt">A related issue is how to label those for and against prohibition. From the nineteenth century to the 1910s, anti-prohibitionists were often called \xe2\x80\x9cantis\xe2\x80\x9d and prohibitionists \xe2\x80\x9cprohis,\xe2\x80\x9d though by the 1920s they were usually labeled \xe2\x80\x9cdry\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwet.\xe2\x80\x9d This text will prefer the simpler and more natural language of \xe2\x80\x9cdry\xe2\x80\x9d for prohibitionists and \xe2\x80\x9cwet\xe2\x80\x9d for anti-prohibitionists, while acknowledging its anachronistic nature for earlier chapters.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Like \xe2\x80\x9cprohibition,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe South\xe2\x80\x9d is a fuzzy term with multiple possible definitions.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en20" href="part0020.html#ch00en20e">20</a></span> This book chiefly uses \xe2\x80\x9cthe South\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to the eleven formerly Confederate states: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. There are several reasons for this. First, this narrative mostly takes place after the Civil War and Reconstruction, which forged a distinctive southern history and identity. However, when briefly referencing the antebellum period, a broader definition of the South is used, including slave states such as Kentucky and Maryland.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Also, the former Confederacy shares a distinctive regional arc for prohibition. After resisting statewide dry laws longer than any other region in the country, statewide prohibition persisted there longer than the rest of the nation. While a few northern states went dry before or in the decades following the Civil War, no formerly Confederate state went dry until Georgia in 1908. Yet by 1918, every formerly Confederate state except Louisiana had banned alcohol on the state level.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en21" href="part0020.html#ch00en21e">21</a></span> Having gone dry, the South was more reluctant to get wet again than other regions. When national prohibition was repealed by December 1933, statewide prohibition was still on the books for most southern states for several more years.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en22" href="part0020.html#ch00en22e">22</a></span> Mississippi did not end statewide prohibition until the 1960s, decades longer than any other state. Even today, a few locales are still dry in the South. Blue laws limiting any sale of alcohol at certain times persist from Texas to the Carolinas.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Another reason to define the South as the former Confederacy is demographic: this book highlights African Americans, so it makes sense to focus on the states where most of them lived prior to and during the Great Migration. This reality prompts further explanation of racial terms.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Regarding race, this book follows an emerging trend among reporters and scholars to use capitalized \xe2\x80\x9cBlack\xe2\x80\x9d rather than lowercase \xe2\x80\x9cblack\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to Americans of African descent, while continuing the convention of using lowercase \xe2\x80\x9cwhite\xe2\x80\x9d for Americans of primarily European descent. Several such vocabular transitions have occurred in the past century, as a survey of scholarly titles over time quickly reveals. \xe2\x80\x9cNegro\xe2\x80\x9d was a common term until the 1970s, when changing norms replaced the term with \xe2\x80\x9cblack\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAfrican American.\xe2\x80\x9d As the latter terms still have widespread currency, this text uses \xe2\x80\x9cBlack\xe2\x80\x9d (as an adjective) interchangeably with \xe2\x80\x9cAfrican American\xe2\x80\x9d in the US context. Following similar scholarly developments, the text uses \xe2\x80\x9cAmerindian\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to indigenous Americans but retains the traditional \xe2\x80\x9cLatino\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to people of Latin American descent (because that follows standard usage in contemporary Spanish, whereas the now-fashionable \xe2\x80\x9cLatinx\xe2\x80\x9d is unpronounceable in Spanish). For all such terms, the author acknowledges that their usage is debated and may well become outdated soon. When quoting others, older spellings and usages are preserved.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">To appreciate the extent to which prohibition brought seismic shifts to race and religion in the South, one first must go back to the days of Bourbon rule, when most southerners, Black and white alike, regarded alcohol as a gift of God.</p>\n</body></html>\n'</p>

To personally acknowledge all who have supported me in this endeavor would exceed limitations of space and time, but it is my joy to thank a few of them by name.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Pride of place goes to my mentors. Barry Hankins oversaw an early version of the manuscript and first drew my attention to Baylor\xe2\x80\x99s history PhD program with his delightful book <span class="italic">Jesus and Gin,</span> which also inspired this book\xe2\x80\x99s title (along with Kristin Kobes Du Mez\xe2\x80\x99s <span class="italic">Jesus and John Wayne</span>). Garth Rosell first inspired me to seek a doctorate in history and prompted me to study prohibition and religion through an independent study. Along with Garth, thanks also to Gwenfair Adams and David Hempton, whose letters of recommendation got me into Baylor\xe2\x80\x99s PhD program.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Studying at Baylor was a privilege and a delight that laid the foundation for this work. Work on a research paper for Kim Kellison\xe2\x80\x99s class on the US South in 2012 focused my doctoral research. Many other professors there, including Beth Allison Barr, David Gawrych, Barry Hankins, Philip Jenkins, Thomas Kidd, Michael Parrish, James SoRelle, Joan Supplee, Joe Stubenrauch, Julie Sweet, and Andrea Turpin, also broadened my perspective and took a genuine interest in my welfare not only as a scholar, but as a person. My fellow graduate students, including but not limited to Scott Anderson, Prisca Bird, Ryan Butler, Alyssa Gerhardt Craven, Tim Grundmeier, Paul Gutacker, Jacob Heiserman, Joel Illif, Adina and Sam Kelley, Elise Leal, Ben Leavitt, Matt Millsap, Jonathan Riddle, Nick Pruitt, Paul Putz, Lynneth Miller Renberg, David Roach, and Brady Winslow, shared with me an even deeper sense of comradery, along with countless sources, insights, and evenings that immeasurably enriched my research and my time in Waco, Texas. Sic \xe2\x80\x99em Bears!</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Colleagues at my current academic home, North Greenville University, have been an inspiration and encouragement to me in this project, particularly my dean, H. Paul Thompson, whose interest in our shared niche field of race, religion, and prohibition led to a job and a close friendship. Professors Feliccia Smith and Paul Yandle, along with other faculty and many students, remind me by word and deed that scholarship must always be in the pursuit of justice. Thanks to student workers Leslie Meyers and Micah Stevens, who helped with research and editing.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The research for this book would not have been possible without financial and archival support. Baylor University\xe2\x80\x99s Graduate School and History Department not only covered the costs of my tuition but also aided travel for research and academic conferences. Baylor\xe2\x80\x99s Presidential Scholarship and Guittard Fellowship further helped me focus on my studies. The Danforth Center for Religion and Politics at Washington University in St. Louis funded my trip to their 2014 Beyond the Culture Wars Conference, whose participants offered valuable feedback on my then-nascent research. Thanks to numerous people at Baylor University\xe2\x80\x99s Texas Collection for the Burney Parker Research Fellowship and at Southern Methodist University\xe2\x80\x99s Bridwell Library for the Visiting Scholar Fellowship and Scholar in Residence accommodations, which greatly enriched my research. The Southern Baptist Historical Library and Archives made possible my research in Nashville with their Lynn E. May Jr. Study Grant, and their staff were also exceedingly helpful, particularly then-director Bill Sumners and current director and archivist Taffey Hall. Thanks to Johnana Clark, Shirley Bowie, and Luther Oelke at the Region 4\xe2\x80\x93South Archives of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America in Seguin, Texas. Particularly during the 2020 pandemic, the Chronicling America newspaper archives sponsored by the Library of Congress and the National Endowment for the Humanities were invaluable. Other online sources such as the Hathi Trust and Archive.org were likewise helpful throughout the process to examine countless digitized sources at leisure. My gratitude goes to all those librarians and archivists whose names I have forgotten yet whose aid led to wonderful discoveries.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">This book owes much to feedback I received when presenting portions of it at conferences and in journals. Discussions on several panels at the American Society of Church History, the Alcohol and Drugs Historical Society, and the Conference on Faith and History pushed me to develop these ideas further. Some key findings in this book were presented for the first time in an article in the <span class="italic">Journal of Southern History</span> in November 2017, which likewise helped me rethink and restructure my argument. Michael Parrish, one of my professors at Baylor, gave invaluable help with getting this work published. Thank you.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Faith and family powered me through this project. In traditional Christian fashion, I thank God\xe2\x80\x94Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\xe2\x80\x94for giving me insight, stamina, and energy to complete this work and for reminding me that even within Divinity there is diverse community, which has inspired me to seek out a plurality of perspectives in my research and to heed marginalized voices. I thank my parents, Nancy and Philip, who taught me that there need be no contradiction between strong faith, sound scholarship, and self-giving love. And who else but Catherine\xe2\x80\x94best of wives and best of women\xe2\x80\x94could be such an unstinting supporter, faithful friend, and exacting editor, all while managing an editing business and writing fantasy novels. Her input has improved the manuscript and my life in countless ways.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Finally, a disclaimer. The views presented in this book may not represent the views of everyone who contributed to this project, including my place of employment. Many have enriched this text with their conversations, suggestions, and insights. What faults remain are fully mine.</p>\n</body></html>\n'</p>

Dogs are completely dependent upon us to provide a sufficient amount of high-quality, biologically appropriate food. They cannot go to the grocery store or open the refrigerator to retrieve what their body is craving! Taking a look at the world from a dog\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, allows us to better appreciate our responsibility to provide biologically appropriate nutritious food. Improper diet and poor-quality food may cause behavioral problems and medical issues in dogs. Poor quality food invites allergies and illness. Many medical and behavioral problems are directly affected by diet, so keeping a beloved dog physically and temperamentally fit by meeting their nutritional needs is essential. You want your dog to thrive, so provide high-quality dog food.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">While experts disagree about nutrition, most will agree that any diet you choose must be nutritionally balanced. Sadly, \xe2\x80\x9c. . . much of the research supporting clinical pet diets does not undergo peer review and is never published in full journal form. Whereas obtaining patent rights to protect intellectual property is understandable, the field as a whole will benefit only if data are published\xe2\x80\x9d (Deng &amp; Swanson, 2015, p. 825). Veterinary nutritionists do agree that a poor diet is the biggest obstacle to achieving overall canine health. It is a daunting task to stay up to date on the latest nutritional theories, brands, and recalls. It is important to take nutritional recommendations from reliable sources whose opinions are not influenced by commercial interest as much as possible. If your dog is healthy there are many choices in biologically appropriate diets. However, if there is illness or disease you will want to follow the recommendations of your trusted veterinarian. You will want to</p>\n<ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">\n<li class="P_ListItem_1"><p class="P_ListParagraph_3">Select healthy ingredients.</p>\n</li>\n<li class="P_ListItem_1"><p class="P_ListParagraph_2">Avoid questionable additives.</p>\n</li>\n<li class="P_ListItem_1"><p class="P_ListParagraph_2">Understand the effects of dog food processing when choosing meal type such as kibble, freeze-dried, dehydrated, air-dried, raw, or home-cooked.</p>\n</li>\n<li class="P_ListItem_1"><p class="P_ListParagraph_2">Proactively research manufacturer reliability.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p id="feeding_a_biologically_appropriate__nutritionally_balanced_diet" class="P_Subheader_-_14">Feeding a Biologically Appropriate, Nutritionally Balanced Diet</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Feeding a truly nutritionally balanced diet requires selecting quality sources so that all essential vitamin, mineral, amino acid, macro and micronutrient requirements are met. A balanced diet requires a variety of healthy meats and veggies. Most vegetables and some fruits can and should be a part of your dog\xe2\x80\x99s diet. For many pet parents, that means finding a few reliable brands and rotating between whole protein sources such as chicken, beef, and salmon, within and between brands. Transition between brands or protein sources over the course of a week or two, gradually adding the new food to the old. Continuously feeding the same food may create allergies and nutritional deficiencies.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Dr. Karen Becker, a leading integrative veterinarian specializing in nutrition recommends a carefully planned biologically appropriate diet for you dogs. She tells us,</p>\n<p class="P_Block_Quote"><i>And while nutritionally balanced, fresh whole food isn\xe2\x80\x99t the cure for every disease that afflicts cats and dogs, it is the very best foundation upon which to build a protocol that can return a sick animal to good health.

Choose a protein-rich, not carbohydrate-rich diet. Canines have few dietary requirements for carbohydrates; however, some commercial dog foods may contain up to 90% grains because grains are inexpensive and increase calories. Grain-free processed kibble is also too often overloaded with calories and carbohydrates. Dr. Doug Knueven, DVM, holistic nutritional expert and sought-after veterinary conference speaker, suggests that you choose a food with a small percentage of healthy whole grains that provide complex carbohydrates. High-protein diets are generally linked to high performance, whereas high simple carbohydrate diets are linked to obesity in dogs (Knueven, 2008).</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 80%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image10.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Normal">There are some excellent dehydrated, air-dried, and freeze-dried foods as well. However, if you choose to feed kibble, try to feed a kibble that contains as many organic ingredients as possible. Purchase a 2-week supply of kibble and keep it refrigerated. Oxidation may degrade the essential nutrients that have been supplemented. Do not pour the food out of the bag into another container. Add water or a scoop of wet food to the kibble: Kibble does not provide enough water during a meal. Chewing kibble does <i>not</i> clean the teeth.</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image11.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Feeding Raw</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">There is a controversial and sometimes contentious debate about feeding a raw diet, however, the evidence against it is inconclusive. Some veterinary organizations, such as the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) and the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) have taken positions against feeding raw food for what they believe to be public safety issues. They say,</p>\n<p class="P_Block_Quote"><i>The AVMA discourages the feeding to cats and dogs of any animal source protein that has not first been subjected to a process to eliminate pathogens because of the risk of illness to cats and dogs as well as humans. Cooking or pasteurization through the application of heat until the protein reaches an internal temperature adequate to destroy pathogenic organisms has been the traditional method used to eliminate pathogens in animal source protein, although the AVMA recognizes source protein, although the AVMA recognizes that newer technologies and other methods such as irradiation are constantly being developed and implemented.</i> (AVMA, 2019, September 5, para. 1).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">If you choose to feed raw, ensure that your dog is eating a nutritionally balanced diet. If you are creating meal plans, include raw meat, organ meat, shredded fruits, vegetables, ground and raw meaty bones, and the appropriate supplements. Raw meaty bones are typically half meat with bone that is consumed, such as chicken necks, backs and legs; turkey necks; pork and lamb necks and breasts, and canned boney fish such as sardines, salmon, and mackerel. Canned fish is pre-cooked. Conveniently frozen raw meals of meat, bone, and vegetables are now widely available. Take precautions with food handling hygiene as you do with any raw meat to prevent possible bacterial or parasitic contamination of hands, surfaces, and utensils. Special precautions must be taken for immune-suppressed individuals who are particularly susceptible to pathogens.</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image12.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Normal">A popular public service resource for comparing both wet and dry brands is <a href="http://www.DogFoodAdvisor.com">DogFoodAdvisor.com</a>.

An excess of 15% over the ideal bodyweight is considered obese and is most often caused by either excessive caloric intake or inadequate exercise, or a combination of the two. Studies indicate that 18 to 44% of dogs are either overweight or obese. Risk factors for obesity include: Dietary practices, female gender, neutering, age, and breed, namely, Labrador Retrievers, Cairn Terriers, Cocker Spaniels, Dachshunds, Shetland Sheep Dogs, Basset Hounds, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, and Beagles. The socio-economic and dietary habits of the pet parent are factors in dog obesity as well (Collard et al., 2006). A scientific meta-analysis review of causes of obesity in dogs says that we should not use body weight alone to evaluate a dog\xe2\x80\x99s nutritional needs when planning meals. Your dog\xe2\x80\x99s lifestyle, neuter status, activity level, age, medical condition, and health history must be considered as well (Birmingham et al., 2014).</p>\n<p id="fresh_water" class="P_Subheader_-16">Fresh Water</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Although truly fresh water is often overlooked for pets, water unfit for you to drink is also most very likely harmful for your dog. Pet parents often mistakenly take the quality of the tap water they give their pets for granted. If you drink spring, distilled, filtered, or bottled water, consider providing quality water as a must for your pet, hand-in-glove with a nutritious diet.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Fresh water is vital for all known forms of life. Unless you are feeding a wet or raw diet, drinking water is most likely your dog\xe2\x80\x99s <i>only</i> source of hydration for metabolic processes. Water regulates temperature, carries nutrients and oxygen to all cells, lessens the burden on the kidneys and liver by flushing out urine and feces and other toxins, aids in digestion, and dissolves minerals and other nutrients so they are accessible to the body. Water also lubricates joints, moistens tissues such as those in the mouth, eyes, and nose, helps prevent constipation, and protects the body\xe2\x80\x99s organs and tissues (Mayo Clinic, 2020a).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">A National Resource Defense Council (2003) study cites an article, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s on Tap,\xe2\x80\x9d revealing that the tap water of scores of United States cities is compromised. Pollution, old pre-World War I pipes, and outdated treatment facilities and processing put dogs at risk from contaminants that breed bacteria and fail to remove toxins such as pesticides, industrial chemicals, and arsenic which can be found in tap water. Diarrhea is often linked to food choice, yet the role that contaminated water may play in diarrhea and cancer is often overlooked. In a recent meta-analysis (Ercumen et al., 2014), aging water distribution systems in the United States and other developed countries were found to allow pathogens that cause diarrhea. Most cities are not in violation of the national standards, yet the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards are weak. For example, the EPA allows 10pps of arsenic although scientists concur there is no safe level of arsenic in drinking water.</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent_SB"><b>Note:</b> Water should <i>not</i> be rationed for housetraining.

There is irrefutable evidence that regular physical activity is vital to help prevent several chronic diseases such as: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer hypertension, obesity, depression, osteoporosis, and premature death (Brendin et al., 2006). In <i>Decoding Your Dog: </i>\xe2\x80\x9cAll Dogs Need a Job,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Mary Klinck, DVM, tells us that a dog\xe2\x80\x99s need for exercise is dependent on life stage, breed, and personality; however, individuals within each breed can vary significantly (Klinck, 2014).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Exercise needs are unique to each dog. Have an integrative force-free veterinarian complete a wellness check for your dog before beginning an exercise regimen. Too much, too little, or the wrong type of exercise and mental stimulation can lead to medical and behavior problems (Marcellin-Little et al., 2005). Sadly, there has been very little research about the optimal frequency, intensity, and duration of exercise for dogs. However, if your dog is overweight, monitor your dog carefully, slowly increasing frequency, intensity, and duration of exercise because the heart rate in overweight dogs during exercise is higher (Kuruvillaa, 2003).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Provide frequent and regular physical and mental exercise appropriate for your dog\xe2\x80\x99s medical condition, age, and breed. Proper exercise not only keeps your dog fit, but it also decreases stress. It is up to us humans to provide sufficient exercise that is fun, while at the same time keeps our dogs safe. Remember our dogs play by their own rules and they simply cannot be trusted to make good decisions, by our standards, on any regular basis!</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Exercise, Mood and Behavior</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Scientists have studied the euphoria known as <i>runners high</i> that is experienced during and after long-distance running and strenuous exercise. Is it any wonder our dogs love to run? The <i>opioid theory</i> is believed to be involved in mood enhancement during and after exercise. The increase in the body\xe2\x80\x99s naturally produced opioid endorphins released during exercise has a positive effect on depression and anxiety as well (Boecker et al., 2008). In a recent study, a lack of sufficient daily exercise was associated with canine anxiety. Dogs who exercised less suffered more noise sensitivity and more separation anxiety distress. More exercise may provide a solution for anxious dogs (Tiira &amp; Lohi, 2015).</p>\n<p id="types_of_exercise_for_life_stages" class="P_Subheader_-_14">Types of Exercise for Life Stages</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Exercise for Puppies\xe2\x80\x94They Have Special Needs</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Puppies have special exercise needs. Frequent self-regulated free-play sessions are encouraged for puppies. Arranging casual play dates with dogs who \xe2\x80\x9cplay nice\xe2\x80\x9d are great for exercise and wonderful socialization for your puppy. Protect your puppy by preventing jumping and falling down. More than 50% of fractures occur in animals less than one year of age (Animal Medical Center of Southern California, 2016). Jumping off of beds, couches, and people\xe2\x80\x99s laps, are major causes of spinal and other bone fractures in puppies. Avoid running, long hikes, and long walks until your dog is between 10 and 18 months old, dependent upon size and breed. Here\xe2\x80\x99s why:</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The bone growth plates are soft cartilage areas that sit at the end of long bones (limbs and pelvis) in puppies and adolescent dogs who are still growing. Bone plates are a weak link, soft and vulnerable to injury. Sex hormone changes in puberty cause the growth plates to close and the plates then calcify and become a stable inflexible part of the bone. Puberty is a landmark for both growth plate closure and for slowly increasing exercise. In puppies the closure is, on average, completed by approximately 10 months of age in large dog breeds, a few months earlier in small dog breeds, and a few months later in giant dog breeds\xe2\x80\x94up to 18 months of age (Provet Healthcare Information, 2013; Marcellin-Little et al., 2005). Specific cautionary measures and additional breed-specific orthopedic concerns should be discussed with your trusted force-free veterinarian.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Exercise for Adult Dogs</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Providing daily runs or alternate opportunities to run and play is vital to your dog\xe2\x80\x99s physical health and emotional well-being. Most healthy dogs love to run! Make sure your dog is properly conditioned before participating in strenuous or athletic activities. Always prepare the muscles to reduce the risk of injury with a warm-up by starting with slow walking and then increasing intensity to jogging gradually over 5\xe2\x80\x9310 minutes. Be certain your dog is comfortable with the level of intensity before increasing duration, distance, or intensity. Consider enrolling your healthy adult dog in an aerobic dog sport class or joining a local group for swimming, agility training, fly-ball, dog dancing, hoops, lure-coursing, or terrain-intensive scent work.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Your dog, more than likely, will not be cautious about excessive exercise so it is up to you to monitor activities carefully. Excessive frequency, intensity, or duration of exercise can have a negative impact causing injury or making an existing condition even worse. Be sure to provide rest breaks, and build endurance slowly, to avoid cardiovascular fatigue. Fatigue can result in injuries. Be on the lookout for limping, excessive panting, or a reluctance to exercise. Exercise should be joyful. Involving other dogs makes physical activity even more stimulating.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Generally speaking, exercise gear may be a topic of heated discussion but not in the force-free training community. Force-free dog trainers recommend a back or front-clip harness for walking and running in order to distribute the pressure across the dog\xe2\x80\x99s chest and body, rather than around the neck and throat structures. If safe for you, your dog, and others, let your dog run naked just with a collar and identification tags.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The benefits gained from safely practiced aerobic and non-aerobic exercise are enriching for both you and your dog. Look for unique trails, parks, beach areas, and neighborhoods to explore. If you prefer to watch rather than run, arrange for a play date with another friendly dog, or visit a safe leash-free dog park<i> if</i> your dog is a well-mannered social butterfly. (See Chapter 9, Dog Parks and Dog Play.)</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Exercise for Aging or Senior Dogs</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">For the most part, just like humans, senior dogs continue their desire for activity and exercise, but at a slower pace. Arthritis may negatively impact your dog\xe2\x80\x99s ability, comfort, and desire to exercise. Understanding both the physical and the behavioral factors involved in our aging dogs provides the best exercise guidance.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Find ways to include your aging dog in your daily activities\xe2\x80\x94being left home alone often quickens the decline of your senior dog\xe2\x80\x99s mental and physical condition. Pay attention to your dog\xe2\x80\x99s comfort limit with distance and other endurance factors on walks. A dog stroller or wagon will allow your dog to continue to be part of family activities. Walk for a short distance and then let your aging dog enjoy a ride in the stroller or wagon even if you have a multi-dog household, keeping everyone together if possible. \xe2\x80\x9cSniffari\xe2\x80\x9d walks, mainly to sniff, are highly enjoyable for most aging dogs. Sniffing is the window to the world where they can experience novelty.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">For dogs who have always loved riding in the car, keep riding! If your dog is too large for you to lift into the car, make a small investment in stairs or a ramp. These aides may be the most practical way of including your dog on these visually enriching and olfactory stimulating adventures.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Scent tracking and interactive toys can be a wonderful source of mental enrichment when physical activity is limited. Therapeutic supervised swimming using a life jacket, socializing with appropriate playmates on the same activity level, or even playing with a respectful puppy whose playstyle is monitored, may help keep your aging dog stimulated.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">For more guidance about senior dog exercise, Dr. Karen Overall (2013, pp. 690\xe2\x80\x93697) has a brilliant section, i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cProtocol for Understanding and Helping Geriatric Animals\xe2\x80\x9d<i>,</i> in her <i>Manual of Clinical Behavioral Medicine.</i></p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">If You Cannot Exercise Your Dog</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">If you cannot exercise your dog, a training-savvy and trustworthy friend or vetted force-free dog walker can help. Do not let anyone else use a choke, slip, prong, or shock collar on your dog. These collars have been shown to cause injuries to dogs. Make it clear to your dog walker that your dog is to be walked on their harness. (See Chapter 16, Leash-walking.)</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">If your dog needs more exercise than you can provide or if you have limited space, when safe for your dog\xe2\x80\x99s age, medical condition, and morphological structure, consider exercising with a lure/chase toy. Some physically challenged pet parents who are unable to exercise their dog outside of the home find a lure-chase toy a convenient way to make sure their dog runs each day. This toy is also recommended for pet parents who do not have enough time to exercise their dog on any given day. The chase-lure toy is especially beneficial for prey-driven, high-activity level dogs or powerful breeds that love and need to run. It works great for small breeds as well and is a lot of fun for the handler.</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image14.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Lure-chase Toy Rules</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">There are some important caveats regarding lure-chase toys.</p>\n<ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">\n<li class="P_ListItem_1"><p class="P_ListParagraph_3">The lure should be kept near the ground, not lifted into the air.

Air is a metabolic requirement for survival, and it is the need that must be met first. Abraham Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s original work, <i>A Theory of Human Motivation</i> (1943, The Basic Needs section, para. 16.) delineates the basic physiological needs to maintain the body\xe2\x80\x99s homeostasis. One of the most basic of these needs is the need for oxygen. Oxygen travels through the lungs and is then transferred to red blood cells that carry the oxygen to all of the organs in the body that require oxygen to function.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">If your dog is having breathing problems, see your veterinarian as soon as possible. Breathing difficulties can quickly become life threatening. Air is a <i>deficiency need </i>(Maslow, 1943) and if dogs are unable to satisfy their need for air, at a minimum they are uncomfortable and at the extreme, they are suffering and often medically endangered. The body cannot function properly with inadequate oxygen and will ultimately fail.</p>\n<p id="airway_injuries_from_choke_and_prong_collars" class="P_Subheader_-_14">Airway Injuries from Choke and Prong Collars</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Dogs are not morphologically built for collars around the neck. Choke and prong collars <i>when used correctly</i>, choke. The use of choke and prong collars exacerbate breathing problems, particularly in our brachycephalic breeds, and may cause medical injury to the trachea, which is essential to breathing.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Choking collars are typically made of metal, chain, or rope euphemistically called a <i>slip lead</i>. Rope is the device of choice used for hanging, therein, the purpose of the slip lead and a noose are much the same i.e., to choke. The metal spikes on prong collars are, additionally, often sharpened to inflict more pain and pressure, resulting in injury. The use of choke and prong collars exerting enormous pressure in pounds per square inch on the spikes, exacerbate breathing problems\xe2\x80\x94particularly in brachycephalic breeds, and may cause medical injury to the trachea, which is essential to breathing. According to Eileen Anderson, in \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Prong Collars Hurt\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cThe pressure on the prong collar is concentrated into multiple small areas (like spike heels) instead of being dispersed with blunted prongs of a medium size (you can obtain prongs that are smaller and sharper), the pressure is approximately 155 times that caused by a flat collar\xe2\x80\x9d (Anderson, 2017, para. 32).</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image16.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Block_Quote_NSA"><b>Dr. Sophia Yin, DVM, on Choke Chains</b></p>\n<p class="P_Block_Quote_NSA"><i>So why do I avoid the choke chain</i> . . . <i>there are many medical and safety reasons. Not surprisingly, strong yanking on the neck with a chain can cause health issues. If the force from a dog pulling on a flat collar raises intraocular pressure [pressure inside the eyes], imagine how high that pressure must rise when you actually yank the dog with a thin chain! Even if your dog has no eye issues, the choke chain is notorious at exacerbating airway issues. For instance, it can worsen coughing in dogs prone to collapsing trachea (weak trachea that flatten more than they should) and affect the ability of dogs with small tracheas, such as pugs and bulldogs, to breathe. </i>(Yin, 2012a, Choke Chain section, para. 5).</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image17.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Normal">This report from a senior veterinary clinician appears in the <i>New York Post</i>, \xe2\x80\x9cPet owners might use choke or prong collars to help train a dog that pulls on the leash, but accidents with these devices can cause serious injury, including permanent neurological problems\xe2\x80\x94or even death,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. David Bessler, senior emergency clinician at Blue Pearl Veterinary Partners in Manhattan. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole point of a choke collar is that it applies force 360 degrees,\xe2\x80\x9d he explains. If a dog surprises an owner and takes off running, the collar snaps the pet back, causing whiplash, or choking. Bessler recalls a fatal case where an owner stepped on a leash as the dog started to run: \xe2\x80\x9cIt caused an upper-airway obstruction and that dog drowned in its own fluid\xe2\x80\x9d (Bessler (n.d.) cited in Sala, (2014).

Due to the serious medical and welfare implications and the increasing popularity of the brachycephalic breeds, efforts to separate fashion from health are needed. Risk factors should be used to guide breeding decisions. In a study on the impact of facial conformity on canine heath, Packer et al., (2015) warns, \xe2\x80\x9cAs such, breeders and buyers should be aware of these risks when selecting a dog and breeding organizations should actively discourage exaggerations of this high-risk conformation in breed standards and the show ring.\xe2\x80\x9d A fundamental rethink in brachycephalic breeding is necessary to save the breeds.</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image19.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Normal">Breathing disorders increase as muzzle length shortens. Breed-related air obstruction disorders are commonly associated with some of the extreme conformation standards established by breed and kennel clubs. Breeds such as the Pug, English Bulldog, Boston Terrier, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, French Bulldog, Boxer, Pekingese, Shih Tzu, Japanese Chin, Shar-Pei, Lhasa Apso, and short-nosed crossbreeds are at great risk of developing BOAS because the soft tissue is crammed within the skull (Burn et al., 2012) often resulting in chronic and debilitating respiratory dysfunction. Thicker necks and obesity are additional exacerbating factors in brachycephalic dogs (Burn et al., 2015).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Pet parents too often dismiss labored chronic breathing difficulties and respiratory noise as normal despite their dogs\xe2\x80\x99 obvious difficulty breathing, overheating, gagging, and choking while on short walks. Dogs may physically collapse and die due to lack of oxygen. Although these pet dogs often show severe clinical signs of BOAS, many pet parents do not recognize that their dog has a breathing problem. Pet parents may believe that these breathing abnormalities are normal signs of aging. Too often these dogs have acute attacks or lose consciousness before a pet parent recognizes breathing is a problem and seek medical help. In a recent study (Liu et al., 2015), 60% of French Bulldog pet parents failed to recognize BOAS in their dogs. Indeed, research finds that 58% of surveyed pet parents of brachycephalic breeds may be suffering because pet parents believe that breathing difficulties, noisy and labored breathing, gagging and choking are \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d for that breed (Burn et al., 2012b). Some pet parents describe the medical symptoms of respiratory dysfunction as \xe2\x80\x9ccute.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">According to Dr. Gerhard Oechtering (2010), faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Leipzig, Germany, \xe2\x80\x9cMalformations and collapsibility of the upper airways are much more complex than previously thought.\xe2\x80\x9d A dog\xe2\x80\x99s nose is thought to be essential for effective thermoregulation. Stenotic nares are pinched or narrow nostrils that make it difficult to breathe and cause snorting and snoring. Laryngeal collapse may occur as a result of stenotic nares and tracheal narrowing and lead to death.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Jemima Harrison, producer of the 2008 BBC Documentary, <i>Pedigree Dogs Exposed</i>, highlights the serious nature of some of the health and welfare problems in purebred dogs. Harrison sheds light on the reality of the suffering of many brachycephalic breeds. She reports, \xe2\x80\x9cMany flat-faced dogs try to sleep sitting or even standing up because their airways block when they drop their heads. It means that some brachycephalic dogs are chronically sleep-deprived\xe2\x80\x9d (Harrison, 2016, para. 1). The Royal Veterinary College at the University of London (O\xe2\x80\x99Neil et al., 2015), reports, \xe2\x80\x9cThese dogs may not be able to enjoy the simple pleasures in a dog\xe2\x80\x99s life such as exercise, play, food and sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Polluted Air</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Do your best to protect your dog from both indoor and outdoor air pollution when reasonably plausible, just as you would for yourself. Exposure to air pollution has been shown to produce cognitive deficits and brain lesions in dogs as shown by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study published in the <i>Journal of Brain and Cognition</i>. The study examined the effect of pollution on brain abnormalities in dogs and children (Barragan-Mejia et al., 2008). Use air purifiers in your home. Avoid smoke-filled rooms and walking your dog when the <i>Air Quality Index</i> (n.d.) is high for humans.</p>\n<p id="sufficient_sleep" class="P_Subheader_-16">Sufficient Sleep</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Sufficient sleep is a fundamental biological need for our dogs. Sleep, along with food, water, and oxygen is essential to survival. Sleep is a critical requirement for optimal health and emotional well-being. Puppies and dogs need to get the quality sleep and the rest their bodies crave. Your dog\xe2\x80\x99s species-specific need for sleep is both similar and different from what humans need. Although sufficient sleep is not discussed frequently, veterinarians, breeders, pet parents, trainers, shelter workers and foster parents are responsible for seeing that the dogs in their care have adequate sleep opportunities. Sleep needs vary with age, health, lifestyle, and among individuals. Sleep strengthens the immune, skeletal, and muscular systems. Dogs suffer physically and psychologically and cannot thrive without sufficient sleep.</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 80%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image20.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Normal">Newborn humans require on average twice as much sleep as adults. Similarly, puppies need <i>lots</i> of extra sleep to grow, heal wounds and store energy to develop and function properly. Many rescue dogs come from very stressful environments, sometimes unavoidably so, with little opportunity for true relaxation. They may be at critical risk for exhaustion and thus, have special sleep needs. To read more about sufficient sleep, see Diane Garrod\xe2\x80\x99s book, <i>Stress Release For Dogs: The Canine Emotional Detox </i>(Garrod, 2021).</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Sleep Deprivation</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Sleep deprivation has been found to increase aggressiveness and decrease effective social interactions (Kahn et al., 2006). Sleep deprivation is associated with a compromised immune system, diabetes, weight gain, obesity, depression, hormonal imbalances, and can more than double the risk of cardiovascular disease (Brown et al., 2012). According to Bentivogliio &amp; Grassi-Zucconi (1997, pp. 570\xe2\x80\x93576), \xe2\x80\x9cPioneering canine experimental studies going as far back as 1894 show that sleep is a vital function, and that the lack of sleep causes brain damage and eventually death. The complete absence of sleep was found to be fatal for puppies in a few days. Adult dogs died after 9\xe2\x80\x9317 days without sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Sleep deprivation shortens attention span, increases anxiety, impairs memory, and has a negative effect on mood. The relationship between sleep deprivation and anxiety is well documented in clinical research (Pires &amp; Anderson, 2012). Anxiety is one of the most insidious emotional consequences of both dream sleep (REM) deprivation and deep-sleep deprivation. Generalized anxiety disorder and phobias are associated with sleep deprivation, so anxiety may also cause sleep deprivation.</p>\n<p id="dog_vs__human_sleep_patterns" class="P_Subheader_-_14">Dog vs. Human Sleep Patterns</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">There may be a genetically hard-wired reason for your dog\xe2\x80\x99s rumbling about during the night. Periodically scanning the environment may be an innate, residually adaptive behavior, which served to detect predators and protect survival in the wild.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The 24-hour internal clock drives all animals. Circadian rhythms are biologically built-in, even in nocturnal animals (Edgar et al., 2012). One study on dog sleeping habits shows that your dog\xe2\x80\x99s rest occurs mostly at night, but their activity increases approximately 2 hours before dawn, and they become most active at dawn, on average. Dogs often nap around the noon hour and have slower activity during the afternoon hours (Tobler &amp; Sigg, 1985). Approximately 44% of your dog\xe2\x80\x99s time is spent in alert wakefulness and 21% in the drowsy state. Adult dogs sleep approximately one-third to one-half of a 24-hour-cycle, with an average internal bedtime of 9 pm and rising time of 4 am, according to a classic dog sleep study (Lucas, et al., 1977). Dr. Alexandra Horowitz (2009) also suggests dogs may have a burst of energy in the evening because of their species-specific sleep-wake patterns.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">As stated above, sleep-wake <i>patterns</i> are species-specific. Humans most commonly sleep for several hours in a single session whereas dogs do not. A 1993 study of sleep-wake activity in dogs showed that the typical pattern of sleeping and waking in dogs is very different than that in people, contrary to popular belief (Adams &amp; Johnson, 1993). Within an 8-hour period, the 24 dogs in the study had 23 sleep-wake cycles on average, of 21 minutes each: they would sleep for 16 minutes and then spontaneously awaken for 5 minutes! Unlike humans, these dogs appeared to become fully conscious during those 5 minutes of wakefulness. When two or more dogs slept together, they each had their own sleep-wake cycling, unaffected by the other dogs cycling. Think of your dog needing power naps throughout the day. Power naps promote performance and learning, help to restore balance to immune and neuroendocrine systems, and are ideal for the genetically hard-wired canine sleep-wake cycle.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Carefully choose the placement of your dog\xe2\x80\x99s bed. Wolves have dens, humans have bedrooms, and so your dog ought to have some sanctuary as well. For daytime power naps, your dog may prefer an open-door crate in a corner of a bedroom or other room, a cloth covered open crate, or an orthopedic bed set apart from the line of traffic in your home. Puppies require more sleep than adult dogs. Keeping puppies in the center of the living room, with human activity continually disturbing their sleep, fosters stress. When setting up containment areas for newborn puppies, responsible breeders should keep each puppy\xe2\x80\x99s sleep needs in mind, balancing <i>Biological Needs</i> with <i>Social Needs</i>. Senior dogs often require more sanctuary space as a safety net apart from other animals in the home to protect their aging bodies and allow for additional sleep needs.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">People pay close attention to the type of spinal and back support our own mattresses provide and understand how important proper sleep support is for our own well-being, however, pet parents often make the mistake of choosing the cutest or cushiest beds for their dogs. All dogs, particularly dogs with long spinal columns such as Dachshunds and giant breeds, need a bed with sufficient spinal support. Why not give your dog the best of both worlds\xe2\x80\x94orthopedic support and cute blankets and pillows if you wish. If the only soft bed for your dog does not allow your dog to stretch fully, a remodel of the <i>dog zone </i>is in order to provide a truly optimal sleep environment for your best friend.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Separate, but close sleeping quarters may help both canines and humans sleep better at night. As a social and domesticated species, emotionally healthy dogs generally want and need to be in close proximity to us. However, just as humans need a quiet environment for restful rejuvenation, so do our dogs. Consider a change in sleeping locations or quarters if your need for sleep is out of sync with your dog\xe2\x80\x99s sleep-wake cycles. When choosing restful sleeping quarters, the National Sleep Foundation (2016) reminds us to factor in proper temperature control, sound, and light.</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image21.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Dog Dreaming and Deep Sleep</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Approximately 23% of your dog\xe2\x80\x99s time is spent in deep-sleep, and 12% in the dream state associated with rapid eye movement (REM) (Lucas et al., 1977). During REM sleep, your dog\xe2\x80\x99s eyes may roll, they may whimper, shake, whine, growl, and even bark on occasion. They often appear to be chasing something with all four legs pumping the air! Fascinatingly, because a large portion of your dog\xe2\x80\x99s brain is devoted to processing scent, your dog may be dreaming in the scent sensory mode as well! \xe2\x80\x9cThose who see smells must remember in smells, too: When we imagine dog\xe2\x80\x99s dreaming and daydreaming, we should envisage dream images made of scents,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Horowitz reports in <i>Inside of a Dog</i> (2009, p. 88).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Puppies spend a greater percentage of time in the dream state than adult dogs, very likely processing all of the new information they are absorbing each day. Dreaming may be a bridge between the brain and behavior, having useful functions similar to dream function for humans.</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image22.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Normal">Dogs adopt many different sleeping positions, some by choice, some as a security measure\xe2\x80\x94and some because the only bed provided is in the shape of a donut. Feral dogs and wolves curl up into a ball with their paws tucked under their body and tails wrapped over the face to conserve body heat and protect their limbs, face, throat, and vital organs. This is the least vulnerable and<i> </i>least restful position for sleeping, however this position allows for a quick leap to the feet for fight or flight. Some dogs sleep on their stomach, also allowing them to jump to their feet easily in the event of a threat or an interesting activity they would like to follow. We also see the \xe2\x80\x9csplotz<i>\xe2\x80\x9d</i> tummy position (rear legs outstretched) that is often more restful, but still ready to leap into action. Dogs that sleep outstretched on their side are genuinely able to relax and are most often feeling secure in their surroundings. Some dogs sleep belly-up with their legs in the air. Generally, this indicates a secure and confident dog because it is a vulnerable position that exposes vital organs and the throat.</p>\n<p id="indoor_shelter" class="P_Subheader_-16">Indoor Shelter</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Dogs deserve and need to have indoor shelter. Because the natural sleep-wake cycles of dogs differ sharply from sleep-wake cycles in humans, your dog needs a quiet, safe <i>dog zone,</i> and a truly comfortable bed to take refuge from a busy daytime household to truly thrive.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">It is Dangerous for Dogs to be Left Outdoors Unsupervised</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">All pet professionals and pet parents should be aware of the considerable and potentially severe ramifications of keeping a dog in an outdoor pen or running loose, unmonitored in a yard. Leaving a dog outdoors unattended may result in medical, emotional, behavioral, and sometimes even legal problems. Of course, there are great benefits to being outdoors, such as fresh air, sunshine, plenty of sniffing opportunities, and the freedom to eliminate as needed. Consider the safety and feasibility of a doggy door to have the best of both worlds with indoor and supervised outdoor access.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Inclement weather, or normal weather for your city, can pose some serious medical risks such as hypothermia or hyperthermia resulting in your dog being unable to control their body\xe2\x80\x99s temperature leading to life-threatening survival issues, suffering, and death. Heatstroke may result from something as unexpected as fence-fighting with a visiting dog in the next yard, or from playing chase through the fence with your neighbor mowing the lawn. Sunburn is painful and can lead to skin cancer. Protect pink noses, bellies, inside of the ears and top of the head, with a non-toxic sunscreen on short-haired/thin-skinned dogs when your dog is outdoors. Neighbors frustrated with your dog\xe2\x80\x99s incessant barking, or children, may accidentally or deliberately release, steal or poison your dog.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Although laws vary between state, chaining or tethering a dog with a rope or a line to a stationary object for any longer than it takes a person to complete a temporary task\xe2\x80\x94approximately 10 minutes\xe2\x80\x94is now illegal in the state of California (Animal Legal and Historical Center, 2014).

There is no empirical data to support the efficacy of this training or that demonstrates that snake-aversion training by shock does all, or any part of, what it promises to do. Additionally, shock training may give pet parents a dangerously false sense of security. Many snakebites occur by inadvertently disturbing a snake and no amount of shock training will prevent that.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Behavior experts tell us that shock is easily misapplied and can traumatize animals, and result in severe and permanent side effects, such as the fear of the great outdoors, or men, for example. The reaction that snake aversion training promises to teach is flight. However, science tells us that the various responses to fear, pain, and shock include fight, flight, freeze, fawn, and others. The <i>Fight-flight Syndrome</i> is scientifically unpredictable according to Nijenhuis et al., in the <i>Journal of Traumatic Stress</i> (1998). Other unexpected and undesirable responses are equally as likely, such as:</p>\n<ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">\n<li class="P_ListItem_1"><p class="P_ListParagraph_3">The dog could successfully go to <i>flight </i>but because of the fear associated with shock, in the dog\xe2\x80\x99s panic, get bitten by the snake.</p>\n</li>\n<li class="P_ListItem_1"><p class="P_ListParagraph_2">The dog could go to <i>fight</i> and get bitten by the snake.</p>\n</li>\n<li class="P_ListItem_1"><p class="P_ListParagraph_2">The dog could go to <i>freeze</i> and become paralyzed in fear and get bitten by the snake.</p>\n</li>\n<li class="P_ListItem_1"><p class="P_ListParagraph_2">The dog could go to <i>fawn </i>in submission and get bitten by the snake.</p>\n</li>\n<li class="P_ListItem_6"><p class="P_ListParagraph_6">Dogs can lose their flight response reaction over time and get bitten by the snake.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class="P_Normal">Pet parents who work with a trainer must be sure that the trainer\xe2\x80\x99s methods are safe: Trainers must never use shock collars.

The safest, least stressful, and most effective way to teach a dog to swim is to use a properly-fitted life jacket. A life jacket often helps new swimmers relax enough to paddle with all four legs. Desensitize your dog to wearing a dog life jacket to keep him afloat and to provide peace of mind for you. Your dog\xe2\x80\x99s innate ability to swim or ease in learning to swim is, in part, determined by breed and body morphology. Even some retrievers need a helping hand to learn and find the confidence to swim for fun and exercise. Breeds with short legs and wide chests such as Bulldogs, Boston Terriers, Corgis, and Pugs, simply were not bred for swimming. Large, muscled breeds such as the <i>bully</i> breeds, require a great deal of energy expenditure in the water due to their significant body mass. Sight hounds, such as Salukis, Whippets, Italian Greyhounds and Greyhounds, have the disadvantage of both large muscles and little body fat to keep them afloat.</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 80%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image24.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Normal">According to an article in the <i>Whole Dog Journal</i> (Colman, 2019), a common but dangerous dog myth is that our dogs already know how to <i>dogpaddle</i> and keep themselves afloat in the water. However, new, and panicked swimmers tend to concentrate their efforts on the front legs alone forgetting to use the back legs. One of the most important things you must teach your dog is how and where to exit the pool, should your dog accidentally fall in or literally get lost while swimming. Do not allow your dog to drink excessive amounts of chlorinated water from the pool and always make fresh water readily available. Rinse your dog off thoroughly after swims in the pool and out in nature. Dry your dog\xe2\x80\x99s ears and dry under the collar. Learn CPR for pets. Avoid contaminated still pools of water and green algae-ridden ponds. Home pools should be fully fenced to protect your dog from swimming unsupervised.</p>\n<p id="temperature_control" class="P_Subheader_-16">Temperature Control</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent"><b>Homeostasis.</b> Temperature control is one central process that is necessary for life in response to environmental changes.

Hyperthermia, more commonly known as heatstroke, is an environmental or exertion caused life-threatening medical emergency in dogs. Dogs regulate their temperature and cool themselves by evaporation (panting) and conduction (transfer of heat to a cool surface). Panting creates a cooling effect through evaporation of saliva in the mouth, on the tongue and from the lining of the lungs. The primary cooling mechanism for dogs is panting with the mouth open (Coren, 2010).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Unlike humans, sweating is not a significant mechanism of cooling for a dog. Dogs have no other efficient way of getting rid of body heat other than panting. Dogs do not have sweat glands, except in their feet. Your dog\xe2\x80\x99s fur coat can easily make your dog susceptible to overheating. Fur is an insulator that keeps the heat (and cold) out, as long as your dog is not in a continuously hot environment. Once the body temperature rises, however, fur slows the cooling process because heat from the body cannot escape. Dogs not properly conditioned to exercise in the heat and humidity, and older dogs may suffer heatstroke very quickly.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Dogs left outdoors or locked in cars may suffer hyperthermia where the dog\xe2\x80\x99s body temperature becomes elevated because it is producing or absorbing more heat than it can release. Other major risk factors associated with heatstroke in dogs according to Dr. Janet Merrill (2020) include:</p>\n<ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">\n<li class="P_ListItem_1"><p class="P_ListParagraph_3">Weight greater than 66 pounds but not associated with obesity</p>\n</li>\n<li class="P_ListItem_1"><p class="P_ListParagraph_2">Obesity</p>\n</li>\n<li class="P_ListItem_1"><p class="P_ListParagraph_2">Brachycephalic breeds</p>\n</li>\n<li class="P_ListItem_1"><p class="P_ListParagraph_2">Environmental conditions\xe2\x80\x94either external temperature and/or high humidity</p>\n</li>\n<li class="P_ListItem_1"><p class="P_ListParagraph_2">Dark coat color</p>\n</li>\n<li class="P_ListItem_1"><p class="P_ListParagraph_2">Fatigue</p>\n</li>\n<li class="P_ListItem_1"><p class="P_ListParagraph_2">Previous episodes of heat exhaustion</p>\n</li>\n<li class="P_ListItem_6"><p class="P_ListParagraph_6">Muzzling</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class="P_Normal">Nylon muzzles that restrict breathing and impede panting are particularly dangerous, disabling your dog\xe2\x80\x99s ability to cool itself. To prevent hyperthermia, <i>never </i>use a nylon muzzle in hot weather or when exercising your dog. If necessary, use a basket muzzle properly sized to allow room for a full-mouthed pant.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Temperatures at or above 105\xc2\xb0F can cause brain damage. If the body becomes overwhelmed by a rise in temperature because of excessive heat and humidity, heatstroke occurs. According to the National Institute of Health (2016), heat waves pose risks for susceptible individuals such as the very young, old, overweight, and the health challenged. The sweltering heat waves of summer and the long-term effects of sudden temperature changes shown in climate change models are predicted to become more frequent.</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image27.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Heatstroke Prevention</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Avoid exercising your dog in hot and humid conditions. Proper hydration is critical to dogs, particularly when exercising in warm conditions. Hydrate, hydrate, and hydrate. In hot weather, before, during and after exercise, use a garden hose or spray bottle frequently to dampen your dog\xe2\x80\x99s fur with water to create an evaporative effect to help your dog stay cool.

Dogs who are panting heavily and if the environment permits, seeking shade, cool surfaces, and drinking water to bring body temperature down are experiencing heat stress. A staggering gait and the appearance of \xe2\x80\x9cdrunkenness\xe2\x80\x9d means your dog may be falling victim to heatstroke. According to Flournoy et al., (2003), \xe2\x80\x9cSigns of heatstroke are: increased panting, drooling, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, rapid heart rate, and dry, sticky, and discolored (bright pink, reddish or purple) gums and tongue. Cortical blindness, cardiovascular collapse, unconsciousness, seizures, coma, central nervous system dysfunction, shallow breathing, and death may follow if veterinary care is not sought immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Know your dog\xe2\x80\x99s normal gum and tongue color so you will recognize changes in gum color should you suspect hyperthermia. If your dog is panting heavily and the gums are a dark pink\xe2\x80\x94stop, rest, come indoors and offer cool water immediately.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Treatment</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Treatment should be rapid and aggressive. Measures should be taken immediately and during transport to the veterinarian to lower the body temperature by spraying your dog with cool (<i>not cold)</i> water and allowing evaporation, opening windows, and using air-conditioning to dissipate the heat. Cool, wet towels along the back of the neck, groin, and armpits (sites of major blood vessels) with airflow can begin the cooling process while on the road to your veterinarian.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Cool the body gradually\xe2\x80\x94do NOT immerse your dog in cold water, administer cold-water enemas, or cover your dog\xe2\x80\x99s body with a wet towel: this can inhibit your dog\xe2\x80\x99s cooling mechanisms (Flournoy et al., 2003). Cold water immersion makes the core temperature rise, rather than decrease. Cold water also causes shivering generating heat and making it counterproductive to cooling.</p>\n<p id="hypothermia" class="P_Subheader_-_14">Hypothermia</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Hypothermia is a medical emergency that occurs when the body is losing heat faster than it can produce heat, causing a critically low body temperature. Hypothermia, in healthy dogs, is caused by either exposure to cold weather, wet fur and skin, or immersion in cold water (Mayo Clinic, 2020b, PetMD, 2010). Dogs at risk for hypothermia include puppies, seniors, those with low body fat, heart disease, kidney disease, and hypothyroidism.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Prevention</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Short-haired, thin-skinned, and toy breed dogs may lose heat particularly fast. If your dog is sensitive to cold, do not hesitate to add a sweater, or hoodie for sensitive ears, to provide extra warmth indoors and out. Add boots to protect tender pads when pads may suffer chemical burns from deicing salt or literally stick to icy pavement. Generally, avoid harsh weather, ice, and snow.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Symptoms</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Shivering is probably the first thing you would notice as your dog\xe2\x80\x99s body temperature drops. Shivering is the body\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to warm itself. If you notice your dog shivering on any occasion, barring a medical condition or fear, take action. However, be aware that <i>shivering stops</i> as hypothermia worsens. Lethargy often follows shivering and paleness (Miller, 2019). When your dog\xe2\x80\x99s body temperature drops, the heart, nervous system, and other organs are unable to function properly. Hypothermia can lead to coma, heart, and respiratory failure and ultimately to death.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Treatment</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The standard of care for hypothermia is to use warmed blankets from the clothes dryer, or a warm (<i>not hot</i>) hair dryer plus a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel against your dog\xe2\x80\x99s abdomen: an unwrapped water bottle may burn your dog\xe2\x80\x99s skin. Check your dog\xe2\x80\x99s temperature every 10 minutes. If the rectal temperature is below 98\xc2\xb0F, seek immediate veterinary care. The successful outcome of treating hypothermia warms the body back to a normal temperature.</p>\n<p id="gentle_grooming" class="P_Subheader_-16">Gentle Grooming</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Force-free training and force-free husbandry care go hand in glove.

Overgrown nails that reach and touch the floor can cause serious functional problems and deformities in your dog. Many dogs are either kept indoors or only run outdoors on soft grassy surfaces, so nails are not gradually worn down by running on concrete or blacktop. Regular nail clipping is necessary so that overgrown nails do not impede your dog\xe2\x80\x99s walking gait or cause skeletal deformities of the limbs and spine, which are often accompanied by pain (College of Veterinary Medicine, Washington State University, n.d.). Dewclaws on the inner side of the paw do not reach the ground so they are not worn down naturally as the dog walks, runs, and plays.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Health Problems and Pain Created by Overgrown Nails</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Overgrown nails lead to a vicious repetitive cycle of pain and avoidance. Dogs avoid having the nails and paws touched because of pain and fear, which leads to painful and unpleasant nail-trimming sessions, which leads to both the dog and pet parent avoiding nail trims, which leads to longer and longer intervals between nail trims, which in the end just leads to more pain.

Worldwide it is exceptional that veterinary specialists in behavior are faculty in veterinary medical schools and yet the biggest single killer of pet dogs (and cats) are behavior problems.\xe2\x80\x9d More dogs are relinquished by pet parents and euthanized by animal shelters for behavior problems than as a result of medical problems. Sadly, the average pet parent does not know that most veterinarians, being medical doctors, are not necessarily knowledgeable about dog behavior. This may become a serious problem if a pet parent seeks behavior advice from a veterinarian not academically schooled in behavior as they often provide opinions on behavior or recommend aversive trainers. Behavior management guidelines set forth by the <i>American Animal Hospital Association</i> (2020) are reviewed below.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The leading edge \xe2\x80\x9cPosition Statement on Humane Dog Training\xe2\x80\x9d from the American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior (AVSAB) (2021a) gives clear guidance as to the trainers and behavioral consultants veterinarians should and should not refer their clients to for training.

Dr. Karen Overall, a close colleague of Yin\xe2\x80\x99s, tells us, \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no training program for what Sophia did. She chose to focus on the weakest link\xe2\x80\x94animals who are fearful in veterinary settings\xe2\x80\x9d (Overall in Zimlich, 2014, section, A Behavior Pioneer, para. 5).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Dr. Yin was a pioneer in her focus and concern about the emotional well-being of pets. Yin combined science with practical and functional applications while developing low-stress handling techniques for treating and working with animals. She shared her research and methods with professionals and with the public in academic journals, magazines, teaching seminars, workshops, books, and instructional materials, including <i>Low Stress Handling, Restraint and Behavior Modification for Dogs &amp; Cats: The Small Animal Veterinary Nerdbook</i>, her best-selling textbook, for veterinary hospitals and individual veterinarian certification (Yin, 2009). Her DVDs include <i>Low Stress Handling of Dogs and Cats: Creating a Pet-Friendly Hospital, Animal Shelter or Petcare Business </i>(Yin, 2012b).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Dr. Yin recognized early in her private practice that more dogs are euthanized due to behavior problems than medical issues. Her contributions improved the quality of life for our pets and increased the safety and efficiency of veterinary staff and other pet professionals, while paving the way for future developments in force-free training and animal care. Those involved in force-free emotional and behavioral modification feel deeply that her passing is a great loss to our field.</p>\n<div id="hoopla-highlight-container"></div></body>\n</html>'</p>

This handbook illustrates how specific needs and force-free training methods are inherently connected, opening the door for conversations with other pet professionals and with clients. In addition, it elucidates how to inspire professionals to invest in a total program of care and training. By design, this handbook encourages collaboration between force-free pet professionals to refer to and support other force-free professionals to achieve optimal well-being for the whole dog. The Hierarchy of Dog Needs (HDN) graphic is used in speaker presentations at veterinary conferences and lectures at local humane societies and pet expositions.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Developing Training Plans</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The <i>Do No Harm</i> handbook identifies primary, secondary, and other problems affecting dogs and guides the reader on the assessment, treatment, and training path. It accounts for both dog and client needs, helping the pet professionals or pet parents to create a comprehensive training plan. This training handbook also provides an outline for class and private consulting.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Increasing Workflow</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Review The Hierarchy of Dog Needs infographic with your client and take notes about problem areas; this will assist in uncovering additional training needs. Creating a <i>to-do list</i> helps the professional to set the training focus on the specific needs of their client and dog, providing a comprehensive plan for both.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">When working up the pyramid, identify unmet and under-met needs and areas of particular interest or concern. Working down the list of training methods on the left side of the pyramid outlines how to address behavioral issues. Details explaining each method are also discussed in Part 1. The remainder of the handbook contains information regarding the application of these methods, which may be used in any order or combination. In this manner, pet professionals may establish the required number of sessions needed for a comprehensive approach to address the underlying motivations of problem behaviors and identify the various contexts where such behaviors occur.</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image4.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Using The Hierarchy of Dog Needs</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The <i>Do No Harm</i> handbook is designed for use in media and the development of professional treatment plans.

Each section can also serve as a standalone topic for a presentation tailored to the interest of a sub-population of dog lovers. For example, one topic of interest is the need for proper temperature control and how to avoid hyperthermia in the summer, and hypothermia in winter. Or a speaker for a breed rescue group might create a presentation on brachycephalic airway obstruction from the section of the handbook devoted to the need for air.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Examples for Pet Bloggers and Television Interviews</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The topics in this<i> </i>handbook and The Hierarchy of Dog Needs make excellent blog material. Force-free advocates can easily use the HDN to explain dog needs and force-free training during television spot presentations.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Examples for Classes</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent"><i>Do No Harm</i> <i>Management and Best Force-free Practices</i> methods illustrated by The Hierarchy of Dog Needs are a great segue laying a foundation for force-free training.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Consider developing a lesson guide of basic skills using the <i>Do No Harm Dog Training Handbook </i>as a foundation, using The Hierarchy of Dog Needs infographic as a handout for discussion during class. Use the training techniques and trainer \xe2\x80\x9csecrets<i>,\xe2\x80\x9d</i> such as capturing, luring, shaping, linking, and real-life reinforcement to teach force-free best practices in the context of teaching name response, sit, down, wait/stay, come, and leash-walking. Trainers who teach classes may rearrange the topic material and teach a basic skill in each class. Referencing the HDN throughout lessons with clients helps to emphasize the importance of meeting needs and learning force-free methods. The goal for any class is empowering clients to use force-free methods for problem-solving when training issues arise when you are not there in class to guide them. Include a copy of the HDN in take-home training packets.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Examples for Private Consultations</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Review the HDN infographic with your client during the first consulting session. Assess training needs and identify the methods you will use from the force-free training methods chart on the left side of the handout. Help address unwanted behavior with explanations of differential reinforcement, counterconditioning, and desensitization methods. Take notes on a master copy. Private consultants can identify behavioral problems needing attention and lead to the development of a treatment plan to determine which basic skills are missing from a family\xe2\x80\x99s repertoire to help the troubled dog and client. Address the needs and topics you feel most competent and comfortable teaching. For example, the client may want recommendations on nutrition and exercise. A conversation on <i>Emotional Needs</i> and trust often reveals fearful or aggressive behavior only a qualified behavior consultant can safely and adequately address. A discussion on <i>Social Needs</i> and attachment may uncover a separation/attachment issue or disorder associated with pet parents, or with other dogs in the family.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Another idea is to create a poster of the HDN<i> </i>for your facility or classroom wall. Have a print company create an unaltered, uncropped (as is) poster from a print-ready file available to force-free advocates from the author.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Examples for Veterinarians</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs (HDN) includes gentle veterinary care as an essential biological health need. As the primary contact professionals, veterinarians are in a position to make the greatest impact on the physical and psychological well-being of the dogs under their loving care. Veterinarians can take a leadership role with pet parents and other pet-related professionals in the animal welfare and force-free movement by using The Hierarchy of Dog Needs<i> </i>and the accompanying<i> Do No Harm Dog Training and Behavior</i> <i>Handbook.</i> They are encouraged to share The Hierarchy of Dog Needs with colleagues, patients, trainers, and at speaking engagements, such as in seminar presentations for veterinary conferences. Veterinarians are encouraged to refer only to force-free/<i>Do No Harm</i> dog trainers and consultants. (See Chapters 1 and 8, Gentle Veterinary Care.)</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Examples for Rescues and Shelters</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Make your rescue or shelter truly force-free by adding a copy of the HDN infographic to the take-home packet with each newly adopted dog. Post a laminated copy on the gate to each dog\xe2\x80\x99s kennel as a reminder to everyone who enters of how to use force-free handling and training techniques with the focus on meeting emotional needs and decreasing stress. Ensure that all management, staff, volunteers, and foster parents have access to a copy of the infographic as a means to educate everyone connected to your adoption agency. Post a copy on your website and social media sites.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Examples for Groomers</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Groomers may blog or offer presentations on the benefits of gentle grooming, the importance of proper hygiene, removal of fur nests that may serve as havens for bacteria, and proper nail clipping to prevent long nails from impeding a dog\xe2\x80\x99s natural walking gait or the structural functions of the spine. Use the handbook to develop a training packet that includes information about pet grooming provided in the gentle grooming sections to help the client\xe2\x80\x99s dog learn to tolerate and even enjoy grooming.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Examples for Responsible Breeders</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Provide a copy of The Hierarchy of Dog Needs infographic in the educational and guidance packets of each new pet parent and discuss the needs and do no harm training practices you want to guarantee to your adoptees.</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent_SB"><b><i>Note:</i></b><i> The reproduction, use, or modification of the Hierarchy of Dog Needs</i><span style=" font-style: italic; font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: super;">\xc2\xae</span><i> is strictly prohibited in any product sold for profit where the primary value of the product is the reproduction itself, such as on t-shirts or coffee mugs.</i></p>\n<p id="future_directions_in_research__law__and_the_role_of_celebrities" class="P_Subheader_-16">Future Directions in Research, Law, and the Role of Celebrities</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The time has come to chart a new course. <i>Do No Harm </i>principles and ethics are fast becoming the gold standard of care throughout the dog training profession. Scientists, legislators, and celebrities are urged to take a clear and unwavering position against the physical and psychological harm our dogs suffer, pioneering the cultural change essential in creating truly dog-friendly societies. Worldwide, progressive zoos and sanctuaries have moved away entirely from using punitive and other aversive methods, even when working with large and potentially dangerous animals.</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 90%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image6.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Normal">Dog bites are a serious and growing public safety issue and it is well-documented in scientific literature that inflicting pain is frequently a cause of aggressive behavior. Bite incidents may result from the direct administration of shock (Polsky, 2000). Aggression is not the only emotional disturbance stemming from punitive and aversive training methods. According to an article in the <i>Journal of Veterinary Behavior, </i>\xe2\x80\x9cGood Trainers: How to Identify One\xe2\x80\x9d (Overall et al., 2006), investigators placed shock collars, prong collars, and choke collars at the top of the list of equipment that causes anxiety, fear, and arousal, which often contributes to an increase in aggression. A growing number of governments in progressive animal-welfare sensitive nations ban the use of these devices on pet dogs.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Canine research scientists are encouraged to take a leadership role in the ethical treatment of companion animals. Evidence illustrates there is no place for shock, prong, choke, or other aversive variables in companion animal research. The rationale against the use of shock and positive punishment is well established in scientific literature. Dr. Karen Weigle (2019), clinical psychologist, affiliated with the University of New Hampshire spoke out on shock saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThis has gone on for this long because this is a population who cannot adequately speak for themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d Who will speak for the dogs? If not us, who? If not now, when? Professional positions opposing the use of aversives in dog training are based on both a sophisticated academic grasp of the neurochemical and behavioral mechanisms at play, and a desire to promote animal welfare in a civilized world (Michaels, 2015d). The hallmarks of leadership in science highlight the detrimental effects that painful devices and practices have on our companion animals. The advent of the Pet Professional Guild (PPG) gives medical professionals, research scientists, and other pet professionals a clear option for affiliation with an international, science-oriented organization. PPG members subscribe to No Shock, No Pain, No Choke, No Fear, No Pain and No Physical Force in dog training. It is understood that science cannot take a stand\xe2\x80\x94but scientists can.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Scientists can easily design research studies that <i>do no harm,</i> thus supporting the<i> </i>instrumental and necessary steps leading to a ban on shock devices used with pet dogs. A survey using the extensive Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ) database (Serpell, 2020), or a separately designed survey, exploring the co-relational relationship between shock training and bites would be of practical value to scientists, animal welfare advocates, trainers, and the public. A survey study based upon a collection of statistics from veterinarians on the injuries and deaths from choke and prong collars would inform and illustrate the true extent of the problem using these devices.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Scientific presentations have real world impact on audiences, and moreover, on our companion animals. Pet professionals from an array of dog-related fields often incorporate these scientific interpretations into their practices and hold them up as a gold standard. New evidence-based practices are the driving force in social commitment to animal welfare policy legislation and the subsequent enforcement of sanctions prohibiting intentional harm to dogs. Scientists who adopt a clear and ethical stand on dog handling and training can help drive social change and shape laws governing animal welfare legislation. Governmental representatives will look closely at what scientists have to say about shock, prong, choke, and dominance training practices. The adaptation of ethics driven science into law puts to rest the unwarranted justification of the use of painful devices and training methods.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Celebrity impact on cultural change is also a powerful and a much-needed force for good. The dog-loving celebrity community can be leading spokespersons for <i>Do No Harm</i> training methods. Celebrities can affect the well-being of dogs across the globe with just a few, clear, and well-spoken words about dog training methods. Employing force-free dog trainers and encouraging the production of truly dog-friendly television shows and films will further endear fans to stars and their pets.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Together a commitment to strengthening animal welfare laws and regulations based upon dog-friendly ethics will bring about a transformation\xe2\x80\x94a sea change in dog training that is long overdue. Increasing penalties for dog abuse and neglect, and developing regulation in the field of dog training ensures trainer competency and a <i>do no harm</i> ethic for dog-related activities. This will accomplish our collective goal. It is incumbent upon each of us to take a clear and unwavering stand on these issues by adopting a force-free ideology concerning the care and welfare of our dogs.</p>\n<div id="hoopla-highlight-container"></div></body>\n</html>'</p>

Marking the emergence of the force-free age in the field of dog training, The<i> </i>Hierarchy of Dog Needs<span style=" font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: super;">\xc2\xae</span><i> </i>is a logical and progressive paradigm whose time has come. The Hierarchy of Dog Needs (HDN)<i> </i>is a wholistic system of care that takes a clear and ethical stand on dog welfare needs and dog-training methods and devices. The HDN is a novel adaptation of renowned psychologist Abraham Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Hierarchy of</i> (human) <i>Needs</i> that emphasizes strengths, positivity, free will/choice, and a belief in the wholeness of animal nature (Maslow, 1943). Research shows that when biological needs, safety needs, and belongingness needs are met for social animals, they are far less likely to display abnormal behavior. The Hierarchy of Dog Needs is supported by scientific evidence as demonstrated in this handbook and makes no apologies for embracing protective ethics concerning our beloved dogs.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs infographic and this handbook provide teaching tools for all types of industry professionals and pet parents to use as a force-free alternative to the more conventional but dated teaching paradigms currently available. Anyone who interacts with or studies dogs, or any animal for that matter, can use it successfully. The HDN lists dog needs hierarchically but the levels are fluid rather than static. Once basic needs have been assessed and met, the training methods may be used in <i>any order</i> of choice, dependent upon the situation, context, and expertise of the handler.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs is a guide to animal wellness and <i>Do No Harm Dog Training. </i>The Hierarchy of Dog Needs<i> </i>was created as a guide to standards of basic care in dog welfare needs and best force-free training practices. The HDN is in use internationally by veterinarians, veterinary behaviorists, dog trainers (including working-dog and police-dog trainers), groomers, shelters, rescues, animal welfare advocates, and pet parents. The HDN has been translated into French, Spanish, Portuguese, Danish, Chinese, German, Estonian, Korean, Greek and Arabic to date, with many more requests awaiting translation.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs is a tool for animal wellness and serves as an essential companion to the <i>Do No Harm Dog Training Handbook. </i>HDN <i>Force-free Training</i> <i>Needs </i>methods and this handbook may be used for both common behavioral problems and the most challenging issues, such as housetraining, loose leash-walking, excessive barking, separation anxiety, fear, dog-dog aggression, human aggression, resource guarding, and more. It can help to identify the primary, secondary, and other problems affecting the dog and help guide the path of training.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">There is an increasingly strong dog-human bond in society and it makes sense that a more dog-friendly, dog-needs paradigm was needed and thus developed. Too often basic needs are not met or are under met. Dog needs are not considered in punitive or \xe2\x80\x9cbalanced\xe2\x80\x9d training approaches where the focus is on punishing unwanted pet dog behavior and not on dog welfare. <i>Do No Harm</i> training makes dogs\xe2\x80\x99 lives better because it is more effective, safer, and has longer lasting effects. <i>Do No Harm</i> is truly dog friendly.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs infographic is not intended to be a treatise on learning theory<i>.</i> Science has examined many different types of learning that include: Habituation, sensitization, desensitization, positive reinforcement, positive punishment, negative reinforcement, negative punishment, extinction, imitation, mimicry, and social learning. In other teaching paradigms, understanding behavior uses Skinnerian-related quadrants as a means to categorize response frequency. Placing every behavior response into a quadrant is not always helpful or the best approach to understanding emotional and behavioral modification and training needs. Only those methods that are physically and emotionally safe for dogs are included on the HDN and taught in the handbook.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The HDN pyramid infographic was designed to be a stand-alone guide covering as much critical territory for dog welfare and training in a one-page format as feasible. The HDN addresses as many primary needs and force-free training methods as possible, however, no infographic can convey all things to all pet professionals. Scientific advisor Dr. Luis Suoto Soubrier aptly points out, \xe2\x80\x9cThe main message and the paramount goal of The Hierarchy of Dog Needs are clear. By introducing further nuances and provisos, even after writing an exhaustive (and exhausting to read) set of rules, we would still, unavoidably, be simplifying reality anyway\xe2\x80\x9d (L. Suoto Soubrier, personal communication, 2015).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The joys, challenges, and responsibilities of pet parenting involve loving care and fit well with The Hierarchy of Dog Needs model. Of primary importance is the enhanced relationship the pet parent nurtures with their dog by using the HDN. Nurturing and developing social skills and confidence in your dog sets the stage for optimal well-being, using force-free training, instead of instilling fear and potentiating aggression.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal"><i>Do No Harm</i> is fast becoming the gold standard of care throughout the dog-training field. Pet parents and professionals are now applying emotional and behavioral modification methods using the <i>Do No Harm </i>model. The time has come to chart a new course making responsible dog training method the best practice.</p>\n<p id="i__the_do_no_harm_ethical_codes" class="P_Subheader_-16">I. The Do No Harm Ethical Codes</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Ethics are at the very heart of <i>Do No Harm Dog Training and Behavior Handbook</i> and the HDN. The embedded <i>Do No Harm</i> ethical code follows force-free, aversive-free, punitive-free training methods alone as best practices. To stem the tide of animal abuse in the dog training industry, canine behavior consultants are raising their voices in regulating practices in the field of dog training.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Pet Professional Guild (PPG) (2020c) is the first international, independent certifying dog training organization to take a clear, uncompromising, antithetical position on the use of shock, prong, choke, dominance, pain and fear-based methods in dog training. Members are fully vetted and must conform to a non-negotiable ethical code of conduct and standards. Members forfeit their membership status for violations of the ethical standards. We need more of these organizations to help protect and defend our dogs\xe2\x80\x99 well-being.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Professional organizations caring for and treating sentient beings all have ethical codes guiding their members and detailing acceptable standards of care.

Aversive techniques are especially injurious to fearful and aggressive patients and often suppress signals of impending aggression, rendering any aggressive dog more dangerous. Aversive techniques include prong (pinch) or choke collars, cattle prods, alpha rolls, dominance downs, electronic shock collars, lunge whips, starving or withholding food, entrapment, and beating.

No single model of behavior can comprehensively understand, explain and predict behavior. The Hierarchy of Dog Needs<i> </i>however<i> </i>is multi-modal, multi-dimensional, and based upon a number of behavioral models providing a more complete and eclectic representation of learning and behavior than any one of the classic models of behavior do alone. Below are some popular <i>schools of thought</i> and theories about the nature of behavior.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">The Behavioral Model</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The Behavioral Model attributes behavior to the environment. The environment drives behavior through antecedents and postcedent consequences. Behavioral Analysis is based upon the <i>if, then contingency</i>. Behavior is learned, that is conditioned through</p>\n<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">\n<li class="P_ListItem"><p class="P_ListParagraph"><i>Classical Conditioning:</i> Associations learned by pairing one stimulus\xe2\x80\x94the antecedent, to another stimulus</p>\n</li>\n<li class="P_ListItem"><p class="P_ListParagraph_1"><i>Operant Conditioning: </i>Reinforcement or punishment also known as consequences or postcedents</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p class="P_Normal">More often than not both classical conditioning and operant conditioning occur simultaneously and are inextricably linked with each other. However, these two types of learning are typically spoken of independently so students and trainers may more easily understand the concepts of behaviorism. With this clarity, practitioners can identify the underlying principles leading to the formulation of a plan for treating a specific problem, behavior, or emotion. The researchers most notably responsible for developing these representational systems of behavior are research scientists Ivan Pavlov and B. F. Skinner.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">This model theorizes that a dog bites a person because the dog has been reinforced or punished for biting, or the dog associates the person with something that previously caused an involuntary physiological response and/or a learned aversive response.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">The Affective Neuroscience Model</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The Affective Neuroscience Model of behavior attributes behavior to functions of the brain modulated by hormones. The emotional systems model theorizes that environment, behavior, and emotion cannot be isolated from each other, resulting in the activation of multiple emotional and behavioral systems in any given schema. Some of the most notable researchers in this area include Charles Darwin, Jaak Panksepp, and Joseph E. Ledoux.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">This model theorizes that a dog bites a person because the dog is experiencing fear, panic, or rage on the neurological and hormonal levels.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">The Ethological Model</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The Ethological Model of behavior attributes behavior to evolutionary adaptive traits with a focus on field studies in natural environments. The identification of <i>Modal Action Patterns (MAP)</i>, inherited tendencies to make specific and complex responses to specific environmental stimuli, helping scientists to understand behavior. Some of the most notable researchers in this area include Charles Darwin, Konrad Lorenz, Niko Tinbergen, and Simon Gadbois.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">This model theorizes that a dog bites a person because it is adaptive to survival to bite when threatened or to compete for resources.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">The Medical Model</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The Medical Model of behavior attributes behavior to wellness or the lack thereof.

Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s Hierarchy of Needs\xe2\x80\x94The Third Force in Behavior</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Students of psychology are familiar with <i>The Hierarchy of </i>[human]<i> Needs.</i> The Hierarchy of Dog Needs is a novel variation of renowned psychologist, Abraham Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s Hierarchy of Needs, adapting a human model of behavior to fit dogs. Similar needs occur in all species.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Animal models of human needs are traditionally used in research where the results and conclusions are extrapolated to humans to help us understand disease and develop treatments in medicine and behavior. Pavlov developed his theories of classical conditioning using dogs as his subjects in research. Skinner developed his theories of operant conditioning using pigeons as his research subjects. The field of comparative psychology explores cross-species comparisons, including those between humans and animals (Tinbergen, 1963).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Maslow, disenchanted with the popularized behaviorist paradigm of his time, cofounded the school of thought in psychology called <i>humanism</i>, the <i>Third Force</i> that emerged subsequent to psychoanalysis and behaviorism (Leahey, 2001). During the summer of 1938, Maslow conducted anthropologic research on a Blackfoot Native American reservation that is believed to have inspired him to theorize a new understanding of the fundamental features of human nature (Taylor, 2019)<i>.</i></p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Humanistic psychology emphasizes strengths, positivism, choice, and a belief in the wholeness of animal nature. In Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s own words: \xe2\x80\x9cSelf-actualized people have the wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder and even ecstasy, however stale these experiences may have become to others\xe2\x80\x9d (Maslow, 1943, pp. 370\xe2\x80\x93396). Does this not definitively describe what we often observe in our dogs? We witness our dogs taking great joy in simple things, over and over again. Taking a (w)holistic view of the sentient dog, The Hierarchy of Dog Needs combines both wholeness and behaviorist templates for wellness and emotional and behavioral modification understanding that both mental events and previously reinforced learned behaviors are causal. Humanism asserts that the present and the future and the past influence us.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Following on the heels of Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s work and others, the former President of the American Psychological Association, and renowned research scientists, Martin Seligman, became the face of <i>Positive Psychology</i> (Seligman, 2020). He called for an alternative to psychology\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crelentless focus on the negative\xe2\x80\x9d and for research into growth, mastery and drive. Today, much research and many academic textbooks explore topics including well-being, the science of happiness, and peak performance. Seligman\xe2\x80\x99s most famous work on <i>learned helplessness</i> (Seligman, 1972) demonstrated that dogs that had previously learned that escape from shock was impossible, would not even attempt to escape once escape was on option. His breakthrough research shows that <i>mental events are causal, even in our dogs</i> (Seligman cited in Schultz &amp; Schultz, 2008).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Maslow further developed his theory in <i>Motivation and Personality</i>, highlighting the significance of relationships<i> </i>(Maslow, 1954). <i>The Hierarchy of </i>[human]<i> Needs</i> remains a very popular framework in secondary and higher education psychology instruction and research. The nature of our relationships with our dogs deserves more attention, thus introducing this adaptation to dog care and training is a unique pleasure.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Dogs have the opportunity to reach an optimal state of well-being when all their needs are met. This is the singular objective of The Hierarchy of Dog Needs principles and procedures, standards of care and best practices. All needs highlighted in the Hierarchy of Dog Needs are interconnected. Needs are similarly dynamic in humans. Researchers find those whose needs for safety and belongingness are met are far less likely to display distraught and disordered behavior than those who have not had these needs satisfied (Schultz &amp; Schultz, 2008).</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent_SB"><b>Note:</b> While a pyramid has become a popular way to represent <i>The Hierarchy of </i>[human]<i> Needs</i>, Maslow himself never used a pyramid to illustrate his levels in any of his writings on the subject.</p>\n<div id="hoopla-highlight-container"></div></body>\n</html>'</p>

The voices taking a clear stand against pain-based collar devices and aversive control methods masquerading as dog training grow louder.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs defines <i>Standards of Care and Best Practices</i> in force-free training. Attending to animal welfare needs <i>and</i> exclusively force-free methods are setting the gold standard in emotional and behavioral modification and training. The ethical code embedded within <i>The</i> <i>Do No Harm Dog Training</i><span style=" font-style: italic; font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: super;">\xc2\xae</span><i> and Behavior Handbook </i>and the <i>Hierarchy of Dog Needs</i><span style=" font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: super;">\xc2\xae</span> (HDN) is grounded in animal welfare principles and dog-friendly dog training. By virtue of providing ethical standards and practices guidelines in the dog training field and industry, we hope to help lead the way, making life easier and more joyful for our dogs and the people who love them.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">In developing a new force-free model of best practices, we no longer leave the door open for aversive/punitive measures in dog training. The extant training models focus largely on quadrants in learning theory yet sadly, have too often been misused as a rationale and justification for the application of punitive methods in training. The ubiquitous misapplication of methods in an unregulated industry is the problem.<b> </b>Doing psychological or physical harm to a captive dog points to a lack of skill and competence on the part of the trainer. There is no justification for harsh treatment or training with dogs, or any animal for that matter, unless one\xe2\x80\x99s life or safety is in immediate danger. The methods detailed in the HDN may be used in any order without risk to the dog: <i>Do No Harm</i> methods never asks or directs the pet parent to hurt their dog psychologically or physically.<b> </b>We seek to \xe2\x80\x9cdo no harm\xe2\x80\x9d physically or psychologically to dogs under our care and training at all times.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Shock collar training is a serious animal welfare concern in the United States and across the globe. Frequently, animal abuse masquerades as dog training. How can the average pet parent be expected to make a well-informed decision with regard to behavior modification tools when so many dog trainers, misinformed professionals, and manufacturers of shock products misrepresent the true nature of their effects? There is simply no place for shock, prong, choke, or other aversive devices in companion animal training.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">In \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Shock is Not Behavior Modification,\xe2\x80\x9d principal investigator Dr. Karen Overall (2013), editor of the Journal of Veterinary Behavior states, \xe2\x80\x9cThe use of shock is not treatment for pets with behavioral concerns\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 111). The popular myth that shock \xe2\x80\x9csaves lives\xe2\x80\x9d has no evidence to support it. Indeed, nothing could be further from the truth. A hypothetical fallacy with the alternative of either shocking a dog or euthanizing a dog is a patently false dichotomy commonly posed by shock proponents. Dr. Overall states unequivocally, \xe2\x80\x9cThe use of shock does not bring dogs back from the brink of euthanasia; instead, it may send them there\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 111). Using punitive methods or devices in training can cause an increase in anxiety that often leads to further behavioral problems, resulting in pet parents relinquishing their animals to overflowing shelters. If progressive zoos are successful in changing the behavior of the animals in their care using force-free training methods alone, behavioral consultants, trainers and other professionals, ought to do the same for our pet dogs.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">In addition, dog bites are an increasingly grave public safety issue, making dog-training methods a public health concern. Bite incidents resulting from the administration of shock are not uncommon\xe2\x80\x94it is well documented in scientific literature that inflicting pain is a cause of aggressive behavior.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs has received a very positive and warm response from the dog loving community. It is in use by veterinary behaviorists, integrative and holistic veterinarians, gentle groomers, dog walkers, pet sitters and service dog organizations, trainers, and pet parents. It is designed for dog trainers teaching classes and those conducting private consultations. The infographic is particularly helpful to shelters, rescues, foster pet parents, and animal welfare advocates. It is in use as a teaching guide in colleges, on websites, on television, and by a growing, international base of pet parents interested in the <i>Do No Harm</i> ideology and practice of dog training.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Dr. Katrina Ward, DVM, remarking on her presentation of the HDN to the Australian Veterinary Association conference said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hierarchy of Dog Needs was very well received and hopefully will be taken up as a routine method of assessing needs and applying humane behavior modification\xe2\x80\x9d (as cited in Michaels, 2015/2020). Dr. Lynn Honeckman, DVM and behavior specialist in Orlando, Florida, uses the HDN to teach pre-vet students in her veterinary clinic presentations. Everyone from national crisis response human and dog trainers to working dog trainers are using it. In a television morning show featuring the Hierarchy of Dog Needs Maarja Tali, guest lecturer at Tallin University in Estonia says,</p>\n<p class="P_Block_Quote__And__Spacing_After"><i>After the basic needs are met, dogs need to feel safe and loved. Relationships are as important to dogs [as they are to humans]. So, before we start drilling or shaping or teaching or training, it is much more important that we have a good trust-based relationship with our dog. One of the most important messages here is that before we even get to training, we need to understand whether the dog is ready to learn.</i> (Tali, 2019)</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_14">How This Handbook is Organized</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent"><b>Part 1.</b> <b>The Hierarchy of Dog Needs Standards of Care and Best Force-free Practices</b> provides the theoretical foundations that support the Hierarchy of Dog Needs for each level of the pyramid and elaborates on each method of <i>Force-free Training.</i> Part 1 includes fully referenced, scientific citations for professionals and readers assuring scientific rigor. The citations enable force-free practitioners and supporters to empirically defend their stance on animal welfare needs, providing the evidence to do so at their fingertips. Part 1 is also designed for speakers, researchers, and instructors as the platform for teaching cutting edge, informative presentations based upon dog-centered needs and the <i>Hierarchy of Dog Needs/</i><i>Do No Harm</i> paradigm. The For the Pet Professional section offers various ways that pet professionals can use The Hierarchy of Dog Needs and the <i>Do No Harm </i>handbook to teach others. Pet professionals will find information on creating presentations, how to use the handbook in private consultations, how to create coursework for class curricula and ideas for using the HDN and the handbook in social media with examples that both carry the <i>Do No Harm/</i>force-free message and enhance and support business goals.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Chapter 1 discusses <i>Biological Needs</i>, including proper nutrition, the need for fresh water, sufficient and appropriate exercise, sufficient air with a focus on brachycephalic breeds, sufficient sleep, avoiding outdoor hazards with indoor shelter, and proper temperature control avoiding hyperthermia and hypothermia. Chapter 1 also illustrates the critical need for gentle grooming and gentle veterinary care. Chapter 2 address the <i>Emotional Needs</i> for security which fosters secure attachment, love, trust, consistency, and benevolent leadership. Chapter 3, <i>Social Needs</i>, explores<i> </i>bonding with people and dogs, and the purpose of play. <i>Cognitive Needs</i> detailing the relevance of choice, novelty and problem-solving activities are examined in Chapter 4.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Chapter 5,<i> Force-free Training Needs </i>defines force-free dog training and thoroughly describes the best practices listed in the Hierarchy of Dog Needs guide: Management, antecedent modification, positive reinforcement, the types of differential reinforcement, classical and counterconditioning, desensitization, the Premack Principle, and social learning are all defined and illustrated with straightforward, clear, dog-centered examples of each method.</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent_SB"><b>Part 2.</b> <b>Setting Your Dog Up for Success</b> is useful for pet professionals and pet-parents, as it lays the groundwork for success in raising a dog: Chapter 6 explores why success begins with choosing a puppy or dog that is likely to fit your lifestyle. In chapters 7\xe2\x80\x938, specific criteria are outlined to help pet parents find a competent and kind dog trainer, and to select a dog-friendly veterinarian and groomer, some of the most determinative decisions one will make in a dog\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime. Chapter 9 explains how to socialize a puppy or dog safely and carefully and how to avoid the common pitfalls of flooding puppies and rescue dogs with stimuli that can cause well-intended plans to backfire. Chapter 10 explores how and why to provide enrichment. Part 2 concludes with a discussion in Chapter 11 on the importance of learning dog body language to better understand how your dog is trying to communicate with you and others.</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent_SB"><b>Part 3.</b> <b>Good Manners and Basic Training</b> focuses on manners and training mechanics in an easy-to-learn and follow step-by-step roadmap of the nuts and bolts of teaching the basic skills everyone wants their dogs to learn. Chapter 12 explains the top ten tips for successful housetraining. Chapter 13 teaches how to replace puppy and adult dog biting, mouthing and chewing with alternate behaviors. In Chapters 14 and 15, training techniques and trainer \xe2\x80\x9csecrets\xe2\x80\x9d provide instructions for teaching dogs with the methods that successful force-free trainers use. All of the basic training needs including calm greetings, no jump, sit, down, wait, lightning recall (come) and leash-walking skills are found in Chapter 16. Part 3 includes numerous examples making sometimes complex learning principles and techniques easy for anyone to teach and understand.</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent_SB"><b>Part 4.</b> <b>When Things Go Wrong</b> addresses behavior problems rooted in emotions that professional trainers and pet parents often find difficult to understand and treat. Largely written for the advanced-level behavior consultant, Chapter 17 focuses on aggression of all kinds providing trainers with the tools they need to address the most challenging cases. This chapter provides easy-to-understand and use protocols for problem-solving on aggression topics including red flags, an assessment intake form for private behavioral consultations, a liability contract, and a veterinary behavioral report. Chapter 17 also explores desensitization and counterconditioning exercises and techniques for frustration reactivity, human and dog-dog aggression, sibling rivalry in multi-dog households, resource guarding and a <i>Do Not</i> list for family, friends, and visitors. Chapter 18 provides assessment, management and adjunct treatment of allergies to the veterinary plan. The nuanced triggers for barking and how to decrease barking and stress are explored in Chapter 19. Chapter 20, helps the pet parent and the consultant develop a dogs and babies plan that begins, ideally, far before the new baby comes home. In Chapter 21, the causes and treatment of fear are explored. In closing, Part 4, Chapter 22, provides a comprehensive assessment and treatment plan for separation anxiety disorder and related behaviors.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">I hope this book may help dogs and the people who love dogs, whether they work with dogs professionally, or touch dogs\xe2\x80\x99 lives in any way. Let\xe2\x80\x99s help them to thrive.</p>\n<div id="hoopla-highlight-container"></div></body>\n</html>'</p>
