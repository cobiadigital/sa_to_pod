With over two million members in 1906, the NBC was then the largest Black-led denomination and the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest Baptist denomination, with more members than the white-led Southern Baptist Convention.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en1" href="part0020.html#ch04en1e">1</a></span> Due to its demographic base before the Great Migration, most of the NBC\xe2\x80\x99s members resided in the South, including the author of the 1905 Temperance Committee report, Texan John Rayner. Though he had backed prohibition in Texas\xe2\x80\x99s 1887 referendum, Rayner reversed himself in 1905 and critiqued prohibition with arguments from Christian theology.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">He declared in the report that any temperance \xe2\x80\x9cnot from above\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cnot Christian temperance,\xe2\x80\x9d effectively insinuating that abstinence from alcohol came from changed hearts, not changed laws. Rayner further articulated ambivalence about prohibitory laws that made men \xe2\x80\x9cmore anxious to procure strong drink\xe2\x80\x9d so that \xe2\x80\x9cthey buy it in larger quantities.\xe2\x80\x9d While implying that prohibitory laws were counterproductive, he advocated strongly for truly Christian temperance, which \xe2\x80\x9ccan <span class="italic">only</span> be enforced by example, persuasion and dissuasion, expressed in personal Christian service\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis mine).<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en2" href="part0020.html#ch04en2e">2</a></span> Rayner thus affirmed the Baptist conviction that drinking was sinful while suggesting that Baptist churches had no need for state prohibitory laws if they would simply apply church discipline. Only upright Christian lives and education, not government power, he maintained, could make men sober. For Rayner, as for many traditionalist Christians before him, regulating such morality was the role of the church, not the state, and the church ought not try to use the government to remove a man\xe2\x80\x99s liberty to choose, even if he chose sin.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Rayner\xe2\x80\x99s 1905 report demonstrated that the same kinds of Christian arguments against prohibition in the nineteenth century continued to be reiterated in the early twentieth-century South. In that era, white and Black voters invoked old Christian traditions of true temperance, liberty, and the Bible to resist the spread of Gin Crow in countless local option and several key statewide elections. In Florida in 1910, Texas in 1911, and Arkansas in 1912, statewide prohibition was defeated by multiracial coalitions in which Black voters cast decisive votes. Dry whites\xe2\x80\x99 defeat in these races sparked a white backlash that suppressed minority votes, empowered white women to vote, and completed the South\xe2\x80\x99s conversion to a dry bastion. Nonetheless, the multiracial resistance to prohibition in the 1910s represented the last great show of Black electoral strength in the South against Jim Crow voting restrictions until the Voting Rights Act over half a century later. Before examining the contributions of African Americans to prohibition elections in the 1910s, however, we must revisit Christian resistance to prohibition across denominations and races.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Background: Christians Defying Gin Crow</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">While Jim Crow and the rise of prohibition advocacy had changed many aspects of southern culture, traditional wet arguments that carried so much weight in the nineteenth-century Bourbon South continued to matter in the early Jim Crow period of the 1900s and 1910s. As before, Christian wets invoked classical temperance, the Bible, and liberty to resist the imposition of statewide prohibition. Clergy as well as laity employed sophisticated and persuasive religious arguments. Some were Methodists defying the teaching of their denominational leaders while others were Episcopalians representing their denomination at the highest levels. Conservative Lutherans condemned prohibition as a modernist innovation while a Baptist seeking humanity\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctranscendental perfection\xe2\x80\x9d argued that it would increase immorality. These Christian arguments formed a potent defense against prohibition and so kept alive the hopes of interracial politics in the South on that one issue for a few tumultuous years.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Despite drys\xe2\x80\x99 apparent monopoly on Christian virtue, many in the early twentieth-century South and around the nation invoked Christian liberty to denounce prohibition. These pious wets included prominent clergy, ranging from African American Baptist preachers to white Episcopalian bishops to Roman Catholic priests. Most of them, however, were laity, frequently politicians, who wielded Christian arguments against prohibition. Wets in the 1900s and 1910s recycled many of the same faith-based arguments from the 1880s, yet this time drys rather than wets had the religious momentum. From newspapers to stump speeches, anti-prohibition rhetoric sought to reclaim the banner of true Christian temperance from the drys.</p>\n<p class="x-b">METHODISTS</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Perhaps the most prominent Methodist layman against prohibition in the 1910s South was Oscar Branch Colquitt, elected Texas governor in 1910. While most other Methodists championed legal bans on alcohol, Colquitt pledged in the opening speech of his 1910 campaign, even before he was first elected, to \xe2\x80\x9cdo what was within my power, honorably,\xe2\x80\x9d to prevent statewide prohibition.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en3" href="part0020.html#ch04en3e">3</a></span> Colquitt justified his opposition to prohibition by appealing to the Wesleyan Quadrilateral: reason, experience, tradition, and scripture. \xe2\x80\x9cMan is a free moral agent,\xe2\x80\x9d he reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9cendowed by his Creator with a knowledge of good and evil, with power to choose between the two. No statute law can rise to a higher level than the rule prescribed by the Divine law.\xe2\x80\x9d This very freedom to choose between right and wrong was the foundation of Christian liberty, while prohibitionists sought to limit that liberty. Since man is a free moral agent, \xe2\x80\x9cstatutes can not cleanse his heart; this is the work of Christian grace.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed, a \xe2\x80\x9cdoctrine of force,\xe2\x80\x9d using the might of law to make men good, was \xe2\x80\x9cwrong in principle; it is intemperance; it is injustice,\xe2\x80\x9d since \xe2\x80\x9cthe application of political force tends to retard rather than to develop [the] growth\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cChristian grace.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot make men good by law,\xe2\x80\x9d he insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is only through education, [C]hristian and charitable influences and growth of intelligent consciousness and responsibility in the individual man himself that this can be done.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en4" href="part0020.html#ch04en4e">4</a></span> Colquitt argued that Christian doctrine opposed prohibition because it retarded one\xe2\x80\x99s spiritual development into a responsible Christian adult.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Colquitt\xe2\x80\x99s trump card, naturally, was Jesus. Quoting Matthew 15:11, Colquitt declared, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Nazarine [Jesus] said \xe2\x80\x98not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d In Colquitt\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, Jesus was opposed to prohibition because he saw evil as a condition of one\xe2\x80\x99s heart and words, not what one ate or drank. Prohibitionists, on the other hand, were like the Pharisees who rejected Jesus due to their focus on ceremonial righteousness. \xe2\x80\x9cTherefore,\xe2\x80\x9d he deduced, \xe2\x80\x9cI am opposed to the application of force [prohibition] and believe that the correct doctrine is to preach temperance and to persuade men into the paths of soberness, honest and correct living.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en5" href="part0020.html#ch04en5e">5</a></span> Colquitt did not merely reach for a proof text but got to the heart of the matter: if Jesus said food and drink do not defile, why should the church insist upon the prohibition of alcohol?</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Colquitt concluded his religious discourse with a reference to Jesus\xe2\x80\x99s best-known parable. \xe2\x80\x9cThe best prohibition law the world has ever known,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis the spirit of brotherly love and the best example of helping the fallen is the action of the Good Samaritan.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en6" href="part0020.html#ch04en6e">6</a></span> In that parable, which his audience would have known, the Samaritan found a man belonging to a hostile ethnic group who had been injured by thieves. Rather than judging or ignoring him, the Samaritan had compassion on him and paid out of his own pocket to provide the injured man medical care. Jesus concluded the story by calling on the audience to love their neighbors\xe2\x80\x94including their enemies\xe2\x80\x94as themselves. The implication was clear: alcoholics were more victims in need of help than enemies in need of punishment. Persuasion to right living by acts of love, not prohibition by force, was the path of Jesus. Wet Methodists could use Scripture just as well as, if not better than, drys.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Not all Methodists agreed. As Colquitt spoke against prohibition in the months leading up to the July 1911 statewide referendum, he aroused the ire of many, including a rising Southern Methodist pastor, Robert \xe2\x80\x9cFighting Bob\xe2\x80\x9d Shuler. Having served as a minister in Virginia, Tennessee, and Texas, Shuler would eventually achieve national fame while pastoring Trinity Methodist Church in Los Angeles from 1920 to 1953. In 1911, however, Fighting Bob was in Temple, Texas, and he issued a sixty-page pamphlet, <span class="italic">The New Issue, or, Local Booze Government,</span> in which he lampooned the governor for his selective use of religion to support anti-prohibition. \xe2\x80\x9cHon. O. B. Colquitt, the moist statesman,\xe2\x80\x9d had \xe2\x80\x9cspasms like unto hydrophobia every time he thought about a preacher \xe2\x80\x98mixing in politics,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d yet \xe2\x80\x9cjust hallelujahed\xe2\x80\x9d when Father Zell, a Catholic priest at Muenster, Texas, \xe2\x80\x9cmade a political speech in the interest of Colquitt\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy\xe2\x80\x9d in 1910.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en7" href="part0020.html#ch04en7e">7</a></span> \xe2\x80\x9cIn the estimation of the moist statesmen,\xe2\x80\x9d Shuler continued, \xe2\x80\x9cit is terrible for preachers to \xe2\x80\x98meddle in politics\xe2\x80\x99 unless it is liquor politics, and then it is just heavenly.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en8" href="part0020.html#ch04en8e">8</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Shuler had a point: Colquitt did denounce preachers\xe2\x80\x99 involvement in politics\xe2\x80\x94except when it benefited his campaign. On the eve of Texas\xe2\x80\x99s July 1911 statewide vote on prohibition, the governor gave a speech in which he denounced radical prohibitionists as \xe2\x80\x9cfanatics\xe2\x80\x9d; then he turned around and praised \xe2\x80\x9cthe Bishops and clergy of the Episcopal and Catholic churches\xe2\x80\x9d in a list of anti-prohibition luminaries that included George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and both of the state\xe2\x80\x99s US senators.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en9" href="part0020.html#ch04en9e">9</a></span> While Shuler rightly called out the governor\xe2\x80\x99s double standard, he also revealed an inconvenient truth: not all politically active clergy were drys. This conundrum led some dry ministers to pressure outliers like Colquitt to either conform or leave.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Even within officially dry Methodist churches, clergy differed a great deal on how much politics they put in their preaching. On one extreme was Bob Shuler. He issued pamphlets, gave stump speeches for prohibition, and involved himself in various local elections. His appointment to the pulpit of University Methodist Church in Austin drew a formal complaint from the church\xe2\x80\x99s board, which insisted their minister stick to the Gospel rather than indulge in politics. On another extreme was D. E. Hawk, Shuler\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor at University Methodist Church, who avoided politics and earned the quiet approval of the wet members of the church board.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en10" href="part0020.html#ch04en10e">10</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Somewhere in the middle and more representative of Southern Methodist clergy was Dr. W. D. Bradfield, pastor of First Methodist Church in Austin. Dr. Bradfield had prominent wets in the congregation, particularly Governor Colquitt, and largely shunned politics from the pulpit. Dr. Bradfield refrained from denouncing his most famous wet congregant even during the fierce 1911 statewide prohibition election, and a grateful Colquitt appointed him a trustee of the state\xe2\x80\x99s school for the blind. In 1912, Bradfield\xe2\x80\x99s bishop, Edwin DuBose Mouzon, called for an aggressive campaign for prohibition across Texas, partly encouraging a primary challenge to the sitting governor from a prominent dry, William Ramsey.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en11" href="part0020.html#ch04en11e">11</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Leading up to the 1912 election, likely under pressure from Bishop Mouzon, Dr. Bradfield finally spoke out against Governor Colquitt for his wet stance. When Colquitt won the race, he fired Dr. Bradfield from the school\xe2\x80\x99s board of trustees and formally left the congregation by requesting his membership letter be returned. However, he had difficulty finding a welcoming Methodist church, even though his political stance did not break any official Methodist discipline.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en12" href="part0020.html#ch04en12e">12</a></span> The episode demonstrated not only the divide between powerful anti-prohibition laity and dry clergy, but also the power of the Methodist hierarchy to convince apolitical clergy to speak out on a divisive issue even when they preferred silence.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Like Governor Colquitt in Texas, the Hon. Henry W. Long in Florida showed that lay white Methodists could deploy Scripture and tradition against prohibition. In September 1910, Long declared himself in favor of local option rather than statewide prohibition for several reasons. Most seriously, he claimed it defied the tradition of the Democratic Party, which \xe2\x80\x9cis not and never has been a prohibition party,\xe2\x80\x9d but instead trusts people at the local level to determine whether they want alcohol. Indeed, the Florida Constitution provided that local option elections must be sixty days away from general elections to keep the issue nonpartisan. Implicit in his argument was the need to avoid divisions among white Democrats that would undermine white-only rule. Additionally, he argued that local option enjoyed great success due to the work of Democrats and temperance workers from organizations such as the WCTU, so statewide prohibition was unnecessary. He warned that prohibition laws \xe2\x80\x9ccan not be enforced and maintained without a strong moral element behind it,\xe2\x80\x9d which could only be given by the consent of \xe2\x80\x9cat least a majority of the citizens\xe2\x80\x9d in a locale. In all of these arguments, he pointed back to old-fashioned Jeffersonian Democratic ideals of local self-government. He capped his observations with an appeal to \xe2\x80\x9cbroad-minded men\xe2\x80\x9d to consider his argument, as well as a crack against the \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow-minded, egotistic crank\xe2\x80\x9d who was fixated on alcohol when there were more important issues at stake: expansionism, economic development, transportation revolutions, monopolies, and corruption, among others. He turned over those \xe2\x80\x9ccranks\xe2\x80\x9d to Jesus, who warned people not to give holy things to dogs or cast pearls before swine (a reference to Matthew 7:6).<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en13" href="part0020.html#ch04en13e">13</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">As with Colquitt, drys attacked the hypocrisy of Long. Some noted that Long had attended the Methodist State Conference the previous fall as a voting delegate, yet the resolution to back statewide prohibition had passed without a single no vote. Thus he either voted yes or was silent at the convention, yet now he took a prominent stance against it. The drys asked rhetorically: \xe2\x80\x9cis his present attitude consistent?\xe2\x80\x9d Much as Colquitt\xe2\x80\x99s pastor eventually denounced him for resisting statewide prohibition, so also the presiding elder (T. J. Nixon) and pastor (M. M. Lord) of Long\xe2\x80\x99s church (St. John\xe2\x80\x99s Ocala) called him out for a similar stance, this time with an open letter.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The letter began with respect for his long service to church and country but insisted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe cause of truth and righteousness demand[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d a response, reminding him of the Southern Methodist (MECS) Florida conference\xe2\x80\x99s declared commitment to prohibition at all levels, including statewide prohibition. They, too, referenced Scripture, selectively quoting Habakkuk 2:15: \xe2\x80\x9cWoe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink, that puttest thy bottle unto him and makest him drunken also\xe2\x80\x9d (but omitted the context at the end of that verse: \xe2\x80\x9cthat thou mayest look on their nakedness\xe2\x80\x9d). They admitted that they might not understand politics, but \xe2\x80\x9cwe can understand a plain statement of the Bible, and a plain law of the church,\xe2\x80\x9d and in the statewide prohibition vote \xe2\x80\x9cwe are called on to vote\xe2\x80\x9d against liquor as \xe2\x80\x9cour Christian duty.\xe2\x80\x9d More than that, it was \xe2\x80\x9cwrong for a church member to vote for liquor\xe2\x80\x9d under any circumstances. They continued: \xe2\x80\x9cNo specious pleas for Jeffersonian democracy, local self-government, or broad-mindedness can justify a church member in violating the duties of his church and trampling under his feet the plain teaching of God\xe2\x80\x99s word.\xe2\x80\x9d Long\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to state prohibition was \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly contrary to the principles of the Methodist church,\xe2\x80\x9d yet his name was \xe2\x80\x9cpublished abroad as a leading Methodist,\xe2\x80\x9d so he brought \xe2\x80\x9creproach . . . upon [the church\xe2\x80\x99s] fair name,\xe2\x80\x9d lending his influence to \xe2\x80\x9cperpetuate the infamous liquor traffic, the greatest enemy of the church.\xe2\x80\x9d They appealed to him in the name of Sunday-school children, of the women of the state, and of God, to leave the ranks of \xe2\x80\x9cthe enemies of temperance and prohibition\xe2\x80\x9d and join \xe2\x80\x9cthose who live and labor for the salvation of men and for the glory of God.\xe2\x80\x9d Their logic was clear: whoever was not with them was their enemy, on the side of the damned.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en14" href="part0020.html#ch04en14e">14</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The power of the Methodists\xe2\x80\x99 top-down church structure to quell dissent and demand political uniformity on prohibition held true for the northern-based and white-led Methodist Episcopal Church (MEC) as well as for Colquitt\xe2\x80\x99s white MECS. Because of its cultural alignment with the North and Republican politics, the MEC encompassed many African American congregations and ministers in the South, including (for a time) John Rayner. A Baptist minister for most of his adult life, Rayner joined the MEC from 1898 to at least 1903, yet he left the MEC and rejoined the more decentralized National Baptist Convention soon before he began openly questioning the wisdom of prohibition.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en15" href="part0020.html#ch04en15e">15</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">While many African American Methodists in the South joined the MEC, many affiliated with Black-led Methodist groups. By 1916, while the MEC was the largest majority-Black Methodist denomination in five formerly Confederate states, the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) or breakaway rival group African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church (AMEZ) took the plurality in the other six states. Another substantial, Black-led group was the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church (later Christian Methodist Episcopal, always CME), which initially enjoyed considerable assistance from the white-led MECS. AME leaders had promoted prohibition at least since Bishop Henry M. Turner of Georgia stumped for prohibition in Atlanta, Tennessee, and Texas in the 1880s, and the denomination worked just as vigorously for prohibition as their white brethren in the Southern and Northern Methodist denominations. In North Carolina, where the AMEZ was the largest majority-Black Methodist church, ministers such as John C. Dancy and J. C. Price spoke out for prohibition in the 1880s as well. The CME joined its fellow Methodists in advocating for prohibition.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en16" href="part0020.html#ch04en16e">16</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">By the 1910s, however, a few Black Methodist ministers worked against the new orthodoxy of prohibition. The Rev. Phillip C. Hunt, a prolific church planter and builder who was then pastor of St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s AME Church in Beaumont, Texas, wrote to the brewers in 1910 to work with them to register voters. His willingness to work with brewers may have hampered his ecclesial career, however; by 1916, Hunt had twice been nominated for the office of bishop of Texas, but he never attained the coveted position\xe2\x80\x94perhaps the professional price he paid for transgressing the Methodist party line on prohibition. While most Black Methodist ministers bowed to the dry consensus, those like Hunt viewed political empowerment of the race as such a righteous cause that it merited working with brewers, if necessary, to achieve their political salvation.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en17" href="part0020.html#ch04en17e">17</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-b">BAPTISTS</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">John Rayner\xe2\x80\x99s Christian opposition to prohibition was not limited to his 1905 Temperance Committee report at the National Baptist Convention, but took expression in his support for wet Methodist politician Oscar Colquitt. In a speech during Colquitt\xe2\x80\x99s 1910 run for governor, the African American Baptist minister John Rayner praised Colquitt for \xe2\x80\x9cguarding manhood\xe2\x80\x99s inalienable rights, and man\xe2\x80\x99s divine privileges,\xe2\x80\x9d such as the liberty to imbibe alcohol, with \xe2\x80\x9cthe faith and fortitude of a martyr.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en18" href="part0020.html#ch04en18e">18</a></span> While Rayner advocated for the restriction of distilled beverages, which he classed with \xe2\x80\x9cmorphine, cocaine, bangue, and absinthe,\xe2\x80\x9d he defended beer and wine as \xe2\x80\x9cvery wholesome and refreshing\xe2\x80\x9d and denounced prohibitory laws against them as \xe2\x80\x9cimmoral in principle, and unrighteous in legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en19" href="part0020.html#ch04en19e">19</a></span> This claim signaled a significant shift from his 1905 NBC Temperance Committee report, in which he essentially agreed that drinking was sinful for Baptists who had taken the pledge; now he was affirming the essential goodness of fermented beverages while still denouncing distilled alcohol and other drugs.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Rather than bringing about a more just and Christian world, prohibition, Rayner argued, would ruin a thriving industry and increase immorality by encouraging casual drinkers to \xe2\x80\x9cmake their own intoxicants, and a bacchanal revelry nightly will appear in too many homes.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en20" href="part0020.html#ch04en20e">20</a></span> While Rayner sympathized with many prohibitionists\xe2\x80\x99 desire to achieve \xe2\x80\x9cthe final triumph of the Christian religion, and the transcendental perfection of humanity,\xe2\x80\x9d he disagreed with legal measures to impose such a result: \xe2\x80\x9cGod does not need the help of the ballot box in the furtherance and completion of his redemptive purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en21" href="part0020.html#ch04en21e">21</a></span> While inconsistent with his former views that all drinking was wrong, he still insisted that only mild fermented beverages were acceptable alcoholic drinks and trusted in God to work salvation by means far greater than political activism.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">His embrace of fermented drinks fit with many other Baptists, who continued to use wine in communion. Many churches in the NBC continued to use alcoholic communion wine, as indicated by indignant reports in 1908 and 1909 reports by the NBC women\xe2\x80\x99s auxiliary, which asked for the use of only unfermented wine in communion.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en22" href="part0020.html#ch04en22e">22</a></span> Their consternation indicated a push in the denomination towards grape juice in the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Supper, but it also demonstrated the persistence of the millennia-long tradition of sacred wine. While white Baptists took the lead in the South for dry advocacy, African American Baptists displayed less ardor for total prohibition.</p>\n<p class="x-b">EPISCOPALIANS</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Though traditionally skeptical towards prohibition, Episcopalians generally avoided the issue in their official church meetings. The journal for the 1910 annual convention for the Episcopal Diocese of West Texas did not reference any prohibition committee, nor did it once mention prohibition, temperance, or the coming statewide vote. Instead of prohibition, Bishop James Steptoe Johnston, a Confederate veteran, spoke of overcoming the divisions from the Civil War and focusing on uniting the churches of the nation.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en23" href="part0020.html#ch04en23e">23</a></span> The next year\xe2\x80\x99s conference in May, just three months before the monumental 1911 prohibition election, did not even mention church political and social activism, much less prohibition. Though stressing church unity, Episcopalians who avoided the prohibition issue seemed to revere the doctrine of the spirituality of the church more than practical collaboration with Methodists and Baptists on prohibition.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en24" href="part0020.html#ch04en24e">24</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Nonetheless, several other Episcopal bishops spoke out against prohibition leading up to Texas\xe2\x80\x99s 1911 statewide vote. The most prominent bishop in the state, George Herbert Kinsolving of the Diocese of Texas, announced his opposition to statewide prohibition in a nuanced articulation of his position in April 1911. While he supported high license fees for saloon operators, local option elections for some cities and counties, and strict enforcement of the law, he doubted the wisdom or expediency of statewide prohibition.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en25" href="part0020.html#ch04en25e">25</a></span> The bishop\xe2\x80\x99s statement drew the notice of Governor Colquitt. In a major speech just days before the statewide prohibition election, Colquitt mentioned Kinsolving by name as an example of the nobler kind of clergy who focused on holier matters than political bickering.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en26" href="part0020.html#ch04en26e">26</a></span> While Colquitt\xe2\x80\x99s statement was self-serving, the fact remained that a notable cleric had publicly rejected prohibition.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Not all the attention Kinsolving received was positive, however. In a remarkable episode of priestly insubordination, Episcopal minister J. T. Smith of Jacksonville, Texas, wrote an open letter in the <span class="italic">Dallas Morning News</span> in May chastising his bishop for defending the saloon, \xe2\x80\x9cthe sum of all villainies,\xe2\x80\x9d against the view of 99 percent of Protestant ministers in the state.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en27" href="part0020.html#ch04en27e">27</a></span> Since the only Episcopal congregation in Jacksonville was tiny, and Smith disappeared from church records, his bold clash with a popular bishop likely cost his career in the Episcopal Church.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en28" href="part0020.html#ch04en28e">28</a></span> Despite Smith\xe2\x80\x99s declamations, Bishop Kinsolving remained in his role until 1928, indicating that his stance did him no professional harm even years after prohibition had entered the US and Texas constitutions in 1919.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The head of the national Episcopal Church joined Kinsolving in speaking out against statewide prohibition. Bishop Daniel Tuttle, leader of the Episcopal Diocese of Missouri and presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church for twenty years (1903\xe2\x80\x9323), denounced prohibition in 1911 as counterproductive, a statement that influenced voters in Texas that year, in Arkansas next year, and in contests throughout the nation. In response, the lightning-rod Methodist minister Bob Shuler castigated him. When a Christian minister refused to back prohibition, he inveighed, even non-Christian decent men would hold their noses and hide their faces at his approach.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en29" href="part0020.html#ch04en29e">29</a></span> Though Shuler\xe2\x80\x99s words had little influence on Tuttle\xe2\x80\x99s standing, the fact that the head bishop of the Episcopal Church would speak his mind on another state\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition statutes strongly suggests he spoke for his whole denomination.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Episcopal clergy who declined to express their view on the volatile political issue gave tacit approval to their presiding bishop and the bishop of Texas, and like Bishop Johnson of West Texas, they simply preferred to invest their words elsewhere. In the 1880s, Episcopal clergy stayed silent on prohibition while Episcopal laymen (including Jefferson Davis) played prominent roles in defeating statewide prohibition.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en30" href="part0020.html#ch04en30e">30</a></span> By 1911, however, several Episcopal bishops dared to speak out against prohibition, and virtually all Episcopal clergy declined to support it. While Methodist and Baptist ministers frequently denounced anti-prohibitionists as necessarily insane and immoral, Episcopalian bishops spoke in more measured terms, took moderated positions, and critiqued statewide prohibition as unnecessarily extreme.</p>\n<p class="x-b">CATHOLICS</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">As with Episcopalians, more traditionalist Roman Catholics rejected prohibition, yet they tended to do so quietly due to concerns of riling up anti-Catholic sentiment. In private, brewers sometimes consulted with Catholic priests, including an archbishop; the vast majority of Catholic clergy kept quiet on the issue.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en31" href="part0020.html#ch04en31e">31</a></span> Catholic priests generally avoided public engagement on divisive political issues such as prohibition, even if most of them shared sympathy with the brewers, to avoid infighting in a minority church or persecution from a hostile Protestant culture.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Father Zell, a Catholic priest in Muenster, Texas, illustrates the danger of Catholics speaking up against prohibition. He was repudiated by his own parish when he spoke up on prohibition in 1910\xe2\x80\x94at least, according to a prohibitionist pamphlet by the Methodist minister Robert \xe2\x80\x9cFighting Bob\xe2\x80\x9d Shuler.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en32" href="part0020.html#ch04en32e">32</a></span> Official Catholic records tell a different story: Father Zell served a church in Muenster, Texas, from 1904 to 1910 and resigned voluntarily out of exasperation at the division between the Knights of Columbus (KC) and the pro-German element, who feared the knights would \xe2\x80\x9cput an end to the \xe2\x80\x98Deutsche Muttersprache\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (German mother tongue).<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en33" href="part0020.html#ch04en33e">33</a></span> The truth likely includes elements of both the official Catholic account and Shuler\xe2\x80\x99s dry propaganda.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The parish struggle between Father Zell and the local KC illustrated the broader struggle over how Catholics should engage prohibition, which was linked to whether Catholics should emphasize their new American identity or European traditions. Father Zell favored his European heritage. Born in W\xc3\xbcrttemberg, Germany, he visited his birthplace in 1908 and doubtless sympathized with the pro-German group in Muenster against the Americanist KC. When he spoke out against prohibition\xe2\x80\x94a cause much more popular in the US South than in Germany\xe2\x80\x94he believed it would rally his divided parish together for a common cause. His plan backfired. As official Catholic records stated, Zell \xe2\x80\x9ctried his best to reconcile the opposing elements but not with much success.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en34" href="part0020.html#ch04en34e">34</a></span> Rather than winning over the KC, it alienated them because they either supported prohibition or feared that Catholic opposition to prohibition would arouse more anti-Catholicism from their dry Methodist and Baptist neighbors.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The KC sought to make Catholicism indelibly American and accepted by their Protestant neighbors. Michael J. McGivney and other second-generation Irish American Catholics, who faced bigotry due to their ethnic background and their faith, founded the KC as a secret society in the late nineteenth century. They named their fraternal order after Christopher Columbus as a sign of their dual American and Catholic identities. The organization was famous in its early days for combatting anti-Catholicism, especially as the anti-Catholic Ku Klux Klan\xe2\x80\x99s popularity and membership skyrocketed in the years following the release of the pro-Klan film <span class="italic">Birth of a Nation</span> in 1915.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The Knights of Columbus in the South were also known for adopting patriotic causes. In addition to the three original degrees of membership\xe2\x80\x94unity, charity, and fraternity\xe2\x80\x94the secret society in 1900 added the fourth and highest degree: patriotism. They held many flag-waving Columbus Day celebrations. They began a program to give away free supplies to US soldiers guarding the border with Mexico in 1916, and that program expanded into a national effort of the KC serving soldiers at home and abroad during World War I. When the war gave way to the Red Scare, the Knights around the nation were fiercely anti-Communist. In their zeal to combat prejudice against their beliefs, they at times enflamed prejudice against those with different beliefs.

In August 1912, Monsignor J. M. Lucey, a Confederate veteran, issued a sermon sympathetic to prohibition in the <span class="italic">Southern Guardian,</span> the official organ of the Catholic church in Arkansas. Lucey acknowledged that German Catholics\xe2\x80\x94about half of the Catholic population in the state\xe2\x80\x94would likely oppose prohibition, and he also noted that local priests should not \xe2\x80\x9ctake a position on a public question\xe2\x80\x9d such as prohibition that would embarrass or disgrace their congregants \xe2\x80\x9cunless a principle was at stake,\xe2\x80\x9d such as to \xe2\x80\x9cend the frightful evils which liquor has introduced.\xe2\x80\x9d Even so, priests should speak \xe2\x80\x9cwithout dictating to the members of my congregation what they shall do.\xe2\x80\x9d He also granted that there were \xe2\x80\x9cno doubt some good men among saloon keepers,\xe2\x80\x9d though \xe2\x80\x9cgood men in the saloon business are in the minority,\xe2\x80\x9d and the industry supported many vices. Lucey also \xe2\x80\x9cconceded that a glass of beer or wine or even stronger drink is not sinful in itself, and becomes sinful only by abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d though for the present time the traffic was so uncontrollable that \xe2\x80\x9cgood citizens\xe2\x80\x9d should close it down until \xe2\x80\x9cthe best people\xe2\x80\x9d could control it, so that a husband and wife could \xe2\x80\x9cenjoy a simple refreshment without loss of self-respect or public reputation,\xe2\x80\x9d as was the case in Europe.

These cultural and theological fault lines prevented an attempted church union between the more conservative wet Missouri Synod (which, despite its geographically limited name, included churches in the South) and the more liberal Augustana Lutherans in the early twentieth century. The Augustana group was sympathetic to modernists, state-church unionists, secret societies, and prohibition\xe2\x80\x94all of which the Missouri faction opposed.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en45" href="part0020.html#ch04en45e">45</a></span> For traditional Lutherans, prohibition was tainted with liberal theology and other dangerous ideas.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The most conservative Lutherans proclaimed prohibition antithetical to Christian liberty, with the Michigan Synod taking the lead.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en46" href="part0020.html#ch04en46e">46</a></span> The synod had in 1909 healed a brief but intense internal split, yet attacked prohibition directly at its annual conventions in 1911 and 1912, suggesting a wet stance united rather than divided at a sensitive time.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en47" href="part0020.html#ch04en47e">47</a></span> Under such circumstances, Director O.

An 1912 anti-prohibition ad in a West Virginia paper rejected the idea that, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen Mohammed denounced \xe2\x80\x98wine as the abomination of the works of Satin [<span class="italic">sic</span>],\xe2\x80\x99 he set a better example for mankind than Jesus Christ\xe2\x80\x9d and denied \xe2\x80\x9cthat prohibition prohibits, except in Turkey.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en55" href="part0020.html#ch04en55e">55</a></span> In 1920, John Erskine, a professor at Columbia University, wrote in favor of \xe2\x80\x9cthe Christian virtue of temperance,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning moderate use, against \xe2\x80\x9cthe Mohammedan discipline of prohibition,\xe2\x80\x9d which unduly restricted individual freedom.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en56" href="part0020.html#ch04en56e">56</a></span> For Christians taking a more traditional perspective, prohibition came from legalism, not true Christianity, and the true cure for the moral decline from alcohol abuse was more liberty.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The prohibition-Islam connection was so pervasive that even the Anti-Saloon League\xe2\x80\x99s national newspaper mentioned it from time to time. In 1921, the <span class="italic">American Issue</span> reprinted a short article on how the world was looking to the United States to see if prohibition might succeed. However, the article claimed that American prohibition \xe2\x80\x9caccepts the famous judgment of Mohammed against strong drink and is curiously in line with the severe Puritanism attributed to authoritative Bolshevism in Russia.\xe2\x80\x9d It is remarkable that the ASL felt comfortable reprinting an article that described prohibition as a mix between Islamic teaching, Puritanical severity, and communist authoritarianism. However, this indicated that ASL partisans were so excited to share an article about the spread of their dry Gospel that they either overlooked its religious and political critiques or did not care whether they were true.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en57" href="part0020.html#ch04en57e">57</a></span> Likewise, when William E. \xe2\x80\x9cPussyfoot\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson (a prohibition enforcement officer known for sneaking up on bootleggers) visited Egypt in early 1927, he wrote to the ASL paper with glowing comments about his dry Muslim interlocutors and disparaging remarks about European \xe2\x80\x9cChristians\xe2\x80\x9d and Jews who sold alcohol in Egypt. When his Muslim friends there stated that \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica, because of the Eighteenth Amendment, had become a Muslim country,\xe2\x80\x9d these connections between prohibition and Islam amused rather than troubled him. When his guests insisted on taking a picture of him wearing \xe2\x80\x9cMoslem head gear,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson included the photo in the article and remarked: \xe2\x80\x9cReally it does not look so bad.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en58" href="part0020.html#ch04en58e">58</a></span> His overall assessment indicated that adherence to the dry Gospel was more important than Christian orthodoxy. Appearing\xe2\x80\x94in convictions and apparel\xe2\x80\x94like a Muslim was preferable to being a Christian who sold alcohol.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">In addition to linking prohibition to Islam, wets also suggested that prohibition undermined Christian responsibility. Without a real choice between good and evil, Erskine reasoned, there was no virtue in an action at all, yet prohibitionists sought to make men good by removing temptation, and they claimed all who \xe2\x80\x9cwould permit the opportunity to get drunk must be an advocate of drunkenness.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en59" href="part0020.html#ch04en59e">59</a></span> Yet Erskine contended that \xe2\x80\x9cdrunkenness has never been more thoroughly condemned or more successfully combatted than when the ideal of freedom with self-control has been sincerely followed.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en60" href="part0020.html#ch04en60e">60</a></span> He located the \xe2\x80\x9cviciousness of prohibition\xe2\x80\x9d in its \xe2\x80\x9cresemblance to drunkenness, in that it also takes away the sovereignty of the mind and deprives character of moral responsibility,\xe2\x80\x9d an affront to both Aristotelian Greeks and early Christians.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en61" href="part0020.html#ch04en61e">61</a></span> This virtue of temperance he derived not only from the church in general, but also from the Apostle Paul\xe2\x80\x99s teaching in Ephesians 5:18 to \xe2\x80\x9cBe not <span class="italic">drunk </span>with wine,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than avoid drink entirely. He closed by citing Luke 7:33\xe2\x80\x9334: \xe2\x80\x9cJohn the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine. . . .

Rather than fostering the temperance taught by Christ and the Apostle Paul in the Bible, prohibitionists were denying individuals their moral responsibility to choose between good and evil and thereby denying them the chance to make moral decisions at all.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Another advocate of Christian liberty against prohibition in the 1910s South was Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s Oscar Wilder Underwood, one of the region\xe2\x80\x99s most prominent politicians in the 1910s and 1920s. Underwood\xe2\x80\x99s political credentials were considerable. After launching a serious presidential bid in 1912 while serving as House majority leader, Underwood switched to the Senate in 1915 and by 1920 had become the leader of Democrats in the Senate, making him the only person to lead a party in both the House and the Senate. He was a renowned defender of states\xe2\x80\x99 rights against federal prohibition, which he denounced in 1914 as \xe2\x80\x9can attempt to rob the states of their jurisdiction over police matters.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en63" href="part0020.html#ch04en63e">63</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Though Alabama first went nominally dry in 1909, Underwood repeatedly defeated dry opponents for the US Senate in several subsequent elections. The 1914 race for an open Senate seat pitted Underwood against prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s national champion in the US House: Richmond Pearson Hobson. Hobson had served along Underwood in the House for the previous seven years and advocated for many progressive reforms, including women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage and direct presidential elections. Underwood claimed that the latter reform would diminish the electoral power of the South. Underwood easily prevailed in the Democratic primary with 89,470 votes to Hobson\xe2\x80\x99s 54,738. Underwood once again sailed to victory against another dry opponent, Lycurgus Breckinridge Musgrove, in the 1920 Democratic primary, even though prohibition had already become the law of the land nationally.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en64" href="part0020.html#ch04en64e">64</a></span> Underwood\xe2\x80\x99s persistent victories as an open wet in an officially dry state demonstrated that many white southerners could and did embrace wet politicians.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">While personally a professed \xe2\x80\x9cTemperance\xe2\x80\x9d man, Underwood claimed that dry laws were ineffectual in advancing that cause. On the floor of Congress in 1914, he stated that great moral issues \xe2\x80\x9chave not been worked out at the point of the sword or with . . . governments,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather come \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the heart, following the teachings of God, and not from the force of men.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en65" href="part0020.html#ch04en65e">65</a></span> Further, he contended, \xe2\x80\x9cProhibition established by law does not produce Temperance,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cmerely makes men outlaws instead of encouraging a respect for law and order.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en66" href="part0020.html#ch04en66e">66</a></span> A prohibition law lacking local support would simply be \xe2\x80\x9ca breeder of fraud and corruption and of contempt for constituted authority.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en67" href="part0020.html#ch04en67e">67</a></span> By his reasoning, the best way to generate real moral reform was through changing souls in church, while merely passing restrictive laws could generate more vice than virtue.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Even drys remarked that wets lay claim to the mantle of true temperance. They admitted that the wets\xe2\x80\x99 argument held a certain attraction <span class="italic">if</span> one could take their rhetoric seriously\xe2\x80\x94but drys just laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe cry of the liquor forces is now for temperance, temperance!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the editor of the Texas Anti-Saloon League\xe2\x80\x99s newspaper. \xe2\x80\x9cProhibition is held up as un-American, fanatical, unreasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d while temperance, meaning moderate drinking, signified \xe2\x80\x9cthe road to freedom, the ladder to achievement, the light of life, the measure of a man, the essence of charity, the soul of religion and the touchstone of true patriotism. This all sounds splendid, it\xe2\x80\x99s charming\xe2\x80\x94it is almost <span class="small-caps2">SUBLIME</span>.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en68" href="part0020.html#ch04en68e">68</a></span> Rather than engaging these claims, however, the <span class="italic">Home and State</span> dismissed them as so much smoke and mirrors, since only voting against the saloons could stop intemperance. The persistent lack of nuance is evident earlier on the same page: \xe2\x80\x9cThe idea that a man can be a Christian and support a death trap of any kind in his community is monstrous.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en69" href="part0020.html#ch04en69e">69</a></span> While able to articulate wet arguments about liberty, drys preferred mocking them to seriously engaging them. After all, momentum was on their side. With Jim Crow reducing wets\xe2\x80\x99 voting power, what could stop prohibition across the South?</p>\n<p class="x-a">Protagonists against Prohibition: African Americans in Florida, Texas, and Arkansas</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Just when it seemed that the rise of Jim Crow would have stifled the political activism of African Americans, they continued to cast decisive votes on statewide races from one end of the Deep South to the other into the 1910s. While they were barred from white-only primaries and outvoted in Democrat-dominated races for statewide office, there was one kind of election where they could still cast the winning votes: prohibition. In Florida in 1910, Texas in 1911, and Arkansas in 1912, African Americans tipped the scales in favor of wets in tight statewide referenda despite Jim Crow laws. Before covering these contests, however, it is crucial to understand why brewers and African Americans became strong political allies in the years leading up to these races.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">African Americans apparently joined the wet coalition out of mixed motivations that changed over time. One motive was the stench of white supremacy in the dry camp, which grew so noxious that some Black ministers defected from drys to wets. Another reason was to protect individual liberty, including the right to drink, which became particularly pressing as African Americans watched their rights contract further. Joining the wet coalition also meant resurrecting the African American political activism rendered moribund by post-Reconstruction intimidation, fraud, and poll taxes. This miracle of reviving a meaningful voice in politics came with the enticing prospect of respect and material gain from powerful whites.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The potent combination of political clout and economic advancement, the double helix of racial uplift, took clearest expression among saloon operators. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, saloons built the foundations of political and financial empires. President John Fitzgerald Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather, Patrick Joseph Kennedy, started his political career in Boston in the 1880s as the owner of three saloons. African Americans also found fame and riches through selling beer. The South\xe2\x80\x99s first Black millionaire, Robert Reed Church Sr., made most of his fortune in banking and real estate, but his first business was running a saloon in Memphis in the 1860s.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en70" href="part0020.html#ch04en70e">70</a></span> Particularly for ethnic and racial minorities, running a saloon meant not only profitable business but also the chance to wield influence among voting-age men.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en71" href="part0020.html#ch04en71e">71</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The shape of interracial politics looked different for each state. Some states, such as Virginia, North Carolina, and Alabama, had effectively eliminated the Black vote by strict Jim Crow laws, while other states had weaker practices in place than enabled more political participation. In Tennessee, poll taxes had effectively eliminated Black voting in rural areas, but it increased the clout of urban political machines that illegally provided poll tax receipts for poor African Americans and poor whites alike\xe2\x80\x94in exchange for reliable election results. These corrupt political machines stymied reformers and led even ardent white supremacists to push for the repeal of poll taxes by the 1930s.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en72" href="part0020.html#ch04en72e">72</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">After the opt-in poll tax arrived in Texas 1902, brewers there did more than any white-owned industry to oppose Jim Crow voting restrictions and mobilize Black voters.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en73" href="part0020.html#ch04en73e">73</a></span> Brewers formed the Texas Brewers Association (TBA) to secure their collective interests and from 1903 to 1911 hired a veteran of the Spanish-American War, Captain Ormund Paget, to manage campaigns and elections.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en74" href="part0020.html#ch04en74e">74</a></span> He opposed the constitutionality of the poll tax, oversaw the payment of poll taxes, disseminated literature, managed many operatives around the state, prevented or swayed elections, spread wet literature, influenced police officers, local officials, and Democratic conventions, and generally advanced the wet cause however possible.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en75" href="part0020.html#ch04en75e">75</a></span> Brewers did not oppose Jim Crow voting out of a sense of principle, but practicality.

Brewers\xe2\x80\x99 correspondence reports that some of these preachers were not only personally wet but were paid by brewers to mobilize the African American vote, and they did their work well. One such preacher, D. R.

The brewers supplied their African American agents with poll tax cards, Lincoln posters, powers of attorney, African American voters\xe2\x80\x99 addresses, daily report sheets, envelopes, night telegraph, and sundry hand-outs. Paget praised these four African American preachers as \xe2\x80\x9cmen\xe2\x80\x9d who \xe2\x80\x9cwill, I believe, do the work and do it satisfactorily.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en78" href="part0020.html#ch04en78e">78</a></span> Brewers had worked for years with African Americans across the South in the 1900s, but that alliance would pay its richest dividends in a series of statewide elections in the South starting with Florida in 1910.</p>\n<p class="x-b">FLORIDA, 1910</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">The Sunshine State in 1910 was a sleepy backwater in the Deep South.

In early October, they urged citizens to register to vote and pay their poll tax by October 8, the last day to qualify to vote in the November election. They warned, \xe2\x80\x9cThe liquor people have qualified every bum\xe2\x80\x94white and black\xe2\x80\x94that they can,\xe2\x80\x9d and urged \xe2\x80\x9cevery good citizen\xe2\x80\x9d to register and perform the \xe2\x80\x9cparamount duty\xe2\x80\x9d of voting for \xe2\x80\x9cyourself, your family, your state and your God.\xe2\x80\x9d The assignment of lower classes of both races to the wets implied that drys were the \xe2\x80\x9cbetter sort,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cgood citizens\xe2\x80\x9d who cared for God and family, while their opponents were not merely wrong, but dangerous sinners.

The reasoning matched the data: the four counties with the most Black voters, which combined provided more than the margin of victory, voted overwhelmingly wet. As ASL national secretary Ernest Cherrington put it in 1914, prohibitionists were not overly worried about the result of the 1910 vote because they won the \xe2\x80\x9cmajority of the white vote,\xe2\x80\x9d and only \xe2\x80\x9cfour counties containing the largest negro vote gave a majority of almost 5,000 against the amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d Further, the language of being \xe2\x80\x9cnot in any sense discouraged\xe2\x80\x9d by the result indicated that drys were only concerned about the white vote, since African Americans\xe2\x80\x99 votes could be easily suppressed by vigorous enforcement of Jim Crow laws. White drys in the 1910s\xe2\x80\x94including northerners like Cherrington\xe2\x80\x94also did not much care about persuading African Americans to embrace prohibition when the former could simply force it upon the latter.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en82" href="part0020.html#ch04en82e">82</a></span> The ideology of prohibition, based as it was on forcing others to be moral, took a particularly dark turn when applied against African Americans in the Jim Crow South. Such an attitude among white drys could not but encourage African Americans to seek political allies elsewhere.</p>\n<p class="x-b">TEXAS, 1911</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">The example of Florida was not encouraging for Texas drys, who had a difficult enough time just getting statewide prohibition on the ballot. After suffering a statewide rout in 1887, drys focused on local option elections until 1908, when they felt strong enough to lobby the state legislature to vote on a statewide vote. Since the Democrats controlled that state legislature and desired to prevent a party split on an issue, they resolved the issue by holding a statewide Democratic primary vote\xe2\x80\x94keeping the issue in the hands of whites only. Despite the exclusion of African Americans (and Mexican Americans), the July 1908 primary narrowly defeated statewide submission, 145,530 against to 141,441 for. Two years later, drys won a more convincing victory for statewide submission, 159,406 for to 131,324 against, or nearly 55 percent for voting on prohibition. For the first time in Texas history, a solid majority of white Democrats supported prohibition.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en83" href="part0020.html#ch04en83e">83</a></span> However, the real test was the election a year away in July 1911, which would determine whether prohibition would enter the state constitution. In that election, however, African Americans could and would vote.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">As with earlier local option votes, Texas brewers worked with Black Baptist ministers to get out the vote against prohibition. One particularly powerful preacher backed by the brewers was the independent Baptist Dr. John L. Griffin, one of Texas\xe2\x80\x99s best-known preachers as well as a gifted songwriter who often set his sermons to poetry and music.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en84" href="part0020.html#ch04en84e">84</a></span> Popularly called \xe2\x80\x9cSin-killer\xe2\x80\x9d Griffin or simply \xe2\x80\x9cthe evangelist,\xe2\x80\x9d he was not without blemish: before 1910 he ingeniously founded the Rescue Association of the United States of America and Africa, an organization supposedly dedicated to \xe2\x80\x9crescuing . . . fallen women\xe2\x80\x9d that in fact functioned as a front to \xe2\x80\x9csecure the payment of poll taxes by negroes\xe2\x80\x9d in order for them to vote in prohibition elections.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en85" href="part0020.html#ch04en85e">85</a></span> The organization was \xe2\x80\x9cendorsed by 125,000 members of Texas\xe2\x80\x9d and sometimes received aid from the brewers.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en86" href="part0020.html#ch04en86e">86</a></span> By November 1910, Griffin had led vigorous rallies in at least fifteen cities throughout the state, including four meetings in San Antonio, and often preached to crowds with African Americans and whites.

Lectures by the Reverend Jim H. McKimil \xe2\x80\x9curging the race to pay their poll tax\xe2\x80\x9d at St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s African Methodist Episcopal Church in Beaumont, which had some four hundred \xe2\x80\x9calive and energetic\xe2\x80\x9d members, prompted the church\xe2\x80\x99s prominent pastor Phillip C. Hunt to write a letter to the brewers who bankrolled McKimil. Hunt pledged the brewers in a December 1910 letter, \xe2\x80\x9cNow anything that I can do to aid the work\xe2\x80\x9d of registering African American voters \xe2\x80\x9cI will gladly do.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en88" href="part0020.html#ch04en88e">88</a></span> By all indications, his power to aid the brewers was considerable.

By 1916 Hunt had twice been a candidate for bishop, served over a dozen churches well by paying off their debt and organizing the construction of their church buildings, and was a politically engaged Republican. With an influential race man like Hunt offering his services to the brewers, many other pastors in the AME doubtless would follow his lead.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en89" href="part0020.html#ch04en89e">89</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Since McKimil spent several days lecturing and distributing literature at various African American churches in Beaumont, his assignment seems to have been to move from city to city, church to church, discreetly mobilizing parishioners to pay their poll taxes and vote against prohibition.

L. Blackshear and John Rayner. Both men had supported prohibition in 1887, reversed themselves by the next major election in 1911, and were influenced by their ties to powerful whites. Blackshear was president of perhaps the most prominent Black college in the state, Prairie View Industrial College (now Prairie View A&amp;M University). Blackshear claimed that he reversed himself on the issue due to \xe2\x80\x9cthe frequent denunciation of negroes by Prohibition orators.\xe2\x80\x9d In addition, pressure from the outspoken wet Oscar Colquitt, who as governor could have arranged for his dismissal from the presidency of a state-funded university, likely played a role in Blackshear\xe2\x80\x99s switch. A dry newspaper editor claimed Blackshear\xe2\x80\x99s defection to the wets \xe2\x80\x9cdid more to mislead and confuse his race than any other one negro in Texas.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en95" href="part0020.html#ch04en95e">95</a></span> More than any\xe2\x80\x94except perhaps John Rayner.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Rayner\xe2\x80\x99s story provides further insight into the shifting circumstances and pragmatic calculation that inspired various African Americans to join the wets. Before moving to Texas in 1880, Rayner was a liquor seller and Republican operative in North Carolina, where his white father had been a Whig congressman. Rayner counseled white Texan drys on how to gain the Black vote in 1887.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en96" href="part0020.html#ch04en96e">96</a></span> Rayner\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for this likely included his lifelong appetite for politics, ambition for personal prestige, and desire to keep the African American vote mobilized in the South after the rollback of Reconstruction.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en97" href="part0020.html#ch04en97e">97</a></span> When the third-party Populists offered the best chance for political and economic progress for African Americans since Reconstruction, Rayner became the leading Black operative for the movement. By 1902, Rayner began cultivating ties with paternalistic conservative whites, apparently reasoning that they were friendlier to African Americans than harshly racist white progressives, including former Populists.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Some of the paternalistic whites Rayner curried favor with were brewers. In 1904, Rayner became the financial agent of Conroe College, a Texan African American school modeled after Booker T. Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Tuskegee Institute, and collected money for the college by ingratiating himself with rich, powerful, conservative, and paternalistic whites, including prominent wets, the same kind of conservative \xe2\x80\x9cpatricians\xe2\x80\x9d he had assailed as a Populist.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en98" href="part0020.html#ch04en98e">98</a></span> While Washington was a dry in Alabama, the equally pragmatic Rayner lived in the far wetter state of Texas. So, by 1905, Rayner had abandoned his previous dry stance and became a wet. The divergent stances of Rayner and Washington suggest that similarly pragmatic African Americans in the South behaved in radically different and even opposite ways depending upon their circumstances.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en99" href="part0020.html#ch04en99e">99</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Rayner\xe2\x80\x99s flexibility was reflected in his religious affiliation as well. Though baptized and raised an Episcopalian like his white father, Rayner was rebaptized and became a Baptist minister in 1880. While losing faith in the dying populist movement he helped lead, Rayner in 1898 joined the Methodist Episcopal Church (MEC), whose local newspaper praised him as \xe2\x80\x9can able orator, a strong writer and a man of no mean ability\xe2\x80\x9d and invited him to write occasional articles.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en100" href="part0020.html#ch04en100e">100</a></span> By 1905 he had rejoined the Black-led National Baptist Convention (NBC), probably to avoid punishment from the Methodist hierarchy: decentralized Baptist church structure gave Rayner greater freedom to express himself on controversial issues such as prohibition.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">In 1905, the same year Rayner issued his anti-prohibition Temperance Committee report for the NBC, he took up a busy schedule lobbying against prohibition throughout the Lone Star State. Though the Texas Brewers Association paid for his traveling expenses, Rayner insisted that he not receive a regular salary from the TBA, but rather whatever they thought him worth in a given situation, which gave him a reputation among the brewers as \xe2\x80\x9cpatriotic\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a mere mercenary.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en101" href="part0020.html#ch04en101e">101</a></span> His alliance with the brewers promised Rayner opportunities for limited personal profit, vengeance against the white progressives who had betrayed populism to racist politics, and the mobilization of African Americans for political action. Perhaps the brewers\xe2\x80\x99 ethnic heritage gave Rayner a further reason to trust them: Adoue was a French immigrant and former resident of New Orleans, and Wahrmund was of German descent, highlighting the non-Anglo leadership of the brewers\xe2\x80\x99 coalition. While society still considered them white and him African American, the lighter-skinned Rayner had grown accustomed to navigating the manifold gradations of racial identity and might have seen these brewers as struggling, like him, to attain full acceptance as men and as American citizens.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en102" href="part0020.html#ch04en102e">102</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">This interracial alliance paid rich dividends for the brewers in 1911. Of over 460,000 votes cast, 231,096 were dry and 237,393 were wet, providing a margin of victory of just over 6,000 votes or 1.4 percent of the total. Given Texas\xe2\x80\x99s relatively generous opt-in poll tax laws, lack of additional Jim Crow election laws beyond the poll tax, and strong connections between African Americans and brewers, the evidence is clear: African Americans determined the margin of victory.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en103" href="part0020.html#ch04en103e">103</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">While some scholars have dismissed the significance of Black voters in the 1911 Texas election, a close analysis of the data shows that Black votes decided the referendum. Though Jared Paul Sutton argues that the poll tax neutralized the significance of Black votes in that contest, he also notes that brewers tried to pay the poll taxes of African and Mexican Americans while failing to analyze how much that work might have effectively countered the poll tax. He also does not attempt to give any statewide estimates of African or Mexican American vote totals, since his research focuses exclusively on a few counties.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en104" href="part0020.html#ch04en104e">104</a></span> Sutton\xe2\x80\x99s data are insufficient to verify his claim that Black votes did not decide the 1911 referendum.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Modest estimates of Black votes lead show that Black voters generated well above the margin of victory for wets in 1911. At the high-end estimate of Black turnout was Ernest Cherrington of the Anti-Saloon League, the most prolific number cruncher for prohibition, who noted that there were 126,000 eligible Black voters in Texas that year. He does not speculate on how many of those 126,000 voted, but his self-proclaimed \xe2\x80\x9cconservative\xe2\x80\x9d estimate had 80 percent of African Americans voters going wet (some contemporary papers put them at 85 percent wet), and he claims they decided the election. He also attributed the dry loss to the 7,000 Mexican voters who \xe2\x80\x9cwere practically as a unit against the amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d which likewise mirrored contemporary accounts in Texan newspapers.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en105" href="part0020.html#ch04en105e">105</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">If there were 126,000 registered Black voters, how many showed up to vote? Sociologist Ann-Marie Szymanski calculated 48.9 percent overall turnout for the 1911 vote, and Black turnout was likely much lower. Three years earlier, John Rayner had promised to mobilize \xe2\x80\x9cat least 50,000 negroes in Texas to pay their poll tax in time\xe2\x80\x9d for the next statewide election, which amounted to about 40 percent turnout of the 126,000 number. The ever-practical brewers never doubted Rayner\xe2\x80\x99s figure in internal reports assessing his value, but instead stated, \xe2\x80\x9cwe need him.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en106" href="part0020.html#ch04en106e">106</a></span> Texas historian Lewis L. Gould estimated 40,000 Black voters annually in the early poll tax period, or a turnout of roughly one-third of eligible voters, is the most likely number of African American voters in 1911. Granting this modest turnout and Cherrington\xe2\x80\x99s conservative estimate of a four-to-one wet-to-dry ratio, African Americans cast more than 24,000 net votes against prohibition, four times the deciding margin.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Even granting the most parsimonious estimate of Black turnout, Black votes still decided that election. Texas historian Alwyn Barr speculated that only 50,000 Black voters held poll tax receipts in 1911 (fewer than half of Cherrington\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconservative\xe2\x80\x9d number) and that only one-third of those likely voted that year. From these numbers, Barr suggests they did not affect the outcome. Yet even if fewer than 17,000 African Americans voted (as Barr supposes), and did so at an 80 percent wet rate, their votes would still have determined the outcome.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en107" href="part0020.html#ch04en107e">107</a></span> By all calculations, Black votes kept Texas wet in 1911 (<span>see <a class="nounder" href="part0016.html#tab07">table 7</a></span>).</p>\n<p class="table-title" id="tab07"><b class="calibre2">Table 7.</b> Black Votes in 1911 Texas Prohibition Election</p>\n<p class="images"><img src="../images/00021.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre3"/></p>\n<p class="x-txtf">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="x-b">ARKANSAS, 1912</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">In September 1912, the prohibition election in Arkansas provided the clearest case not only that African American votes decided statewide elections, but also that opposition to prohibition and to Jim Crow went hand in hand.

Clergy in Garland County published a full-page ad in a local newspaper to advocate for state prohibition. Signatories included many white-led churches\xe2\x80\x94mostly Baptist and Methodist, as well as Presbyterian, Salvation Army, and \xe2\x80\x9cChristian\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and a few Black church leaders, including two from Second Baptist churches (traditionally Black) and one from a CME church.

An article in an Arkansas paper in September 1912 by the state WCTU quoted a passage from Frances Willard, a proponent of women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage, to plead with men to vote out the saloon on behalf of the \xe2\x80\x9cunrepresented class\xe2\x80\x9d of women.

While many women in the WCTU hoped to advance their enfranchisement through prohibition, they adapted their message in the South to encourage white men to fulfill their role of safeguarding white women\xe2\x80\x99s honor through opposing alcohol.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">That September, however, the drys were disappointed: wets won a clear victory, with 85,358 wet votes to 69,390 dry votes, thanks to an alliance between brewers and Black voters.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en112" href="part0020.html#ch04en112e">112</a></span> The ASL admitted that it lost the Arkansas prohibition referendum because it coincided with a vote on a grandfather clause to disfranchise African Americans, and the liquor forces allied with Black voters to defeat both measures. As the ASL put it: \xe2\x80\x9cThe negroes in Arkansas seldom vote, but this fall they swarmed to the ballot boxes in large numbers. A trade was made between the liquor forces and the colored voters by which the liquor men were to vote against disfranchisement and in return the negroes were to vote against prohibition.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en113" href="part0020.html#ch04en113e">113</a></span> The language of \xe2\x80\x9cswarmed\xe2\x80\x9d in reference to Black voters indicates the ASL\xe2\x80\x99s view that they were inferior to whites. However, there is no reason to doubt the factual accuracy of the claim of a deal between the alcohol traffic (as drys would say) and African Americans to preserve their rights. This fits with evidence from Texas and Florida of African Americans aligning with the alcohol lobby to advance their shared interests and makes more explicit than any previous election the connection between fighting prohibition and combating Jim Crow voting restrictions. In Arkansas in 1912, drys admitted that a multiracial coalition had once again defeated Gin Crow.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Tallying the Votes, Again</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Taken together, the three statewide elections in Florida, Texas, and Arkansas demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt the impact of African American voters on a level many scholars did not believe possible in the early Jim Crow period. <a class="nounder" href="part0016.html#tab08"><span>Table 8</span></a> examines four statewide elections in the South between 1910 and 1912 where wets won, with particular attention to African American church-member populations in 1916, a few years after those votes took place. Given that Cherrington had estimated only 126,000 eligible Black voters in Texas\xe2\x80\x99s 1911 contest, and 1916 is several years after the contests, it seems reasonable that at least a quarter of the Black church membership in each state was registered to vote, and even modest turnout of that one-quarter meant thousands\xe2\x80\x94or for Texas and Arkansas, tens of thousands\xe2\x80\x94of voters, more than enough to tip each election. Since contemporary accounts clearly stated that Black voters carried the day in Florida, Texas, and Arkansas, it seems reasonable to conclude that they might have done so in other states as well.</p>\n<p class="table-title" id="tab08"><b class="calibre2">Table 8.</b> Southern Statewide Prohibition Referenda Won by Wets, 1910\xe2\x80\x931912</p>\n<p class="images"><img src="../images/00022.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre3"/></p>\n<p class="x-a">Aftermath: Gin Crow Triumphant</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Despite the early strong resistance to drys\xe2\x80\x99 efforts, the potent multiracial wet alliance that forestalled statewide prohibition across the South in the early 1910s crumbled by the end of the decade, replaced by an order fulfilling Jim Crow\xe2\x80\x99s promised marginalization of Black voters and instilling legal alcohol bans on state and federal levels. Internal and external factors contributed to this decline. Internally, racial tensions roiled the wet coalition as brewers failed to treat their Black allies as equals and so generated resentment and disillusionment from a vital constituency. Externally, white drys cried out for more rigorous enforcement of Jim Crow election laws to neutralize the racial minority vote even further while calling for a political voice for white women to counteract \xe2\x80\x9cignorant\xe2\x80\x9d wet voters.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Much of the failure of the wet coalition was the fault of the short-sighted alcohol lobby. Despite their shared success, ethnic white brewers could be just as condescending as white drys. Despite success in many local option elections and the 1911 statewide vote, fissures broke out between the brewers and Black activists who did not feel they were receiving appropriate respect for their work, and brewers paid the price. In Limestone County in August 1909, an unnamed operative of the brewers thought the county would stay wet in a local option election with 90 percent of the African American vote but regretted spending money to \xe2\x80\x9cplay with the negro saloonkeeper.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en114" href="part0020.html#ch04en114e">114</a></span> By August 11, after the election, the operative had trouble explaining how the election that should have been won by two hundred was lost by ten. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only way I can account for the result,\xe2\x80\x9d he confessed, \xe2\x80\x9cis that the negroes took their money and retaliated by voting the pro ticket to even up for the treatment received by the negro Dave Johnson that [a brewer operative] put out of business after putting him in business.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en115" href="part0020.html#ch04en115e">115</a></span> The brewers learned the hard way that African American men could not be simply bought off; they wanted to be treated as men.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">By the summer of 1912, even Rayner felt that he was being used. \xe2\x80\x9cYou say \xe2\x80\x98you will have to excuse me [from giving more financial support],\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote to the brewers that July, \xe2\x80\x9cbut when you need a colored vote and call on me I shall need tell you to excuse me.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en116" href="part0020.html#ch04en116e">116</a></span> The brewers\xe2\x80\x99 bewildered response to his request for compensation demonstrates their incomprehension of the value of their African American allies, and the lack of additional correspondence from Rayner in the records indicates that he followed through on his threat.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en117" href="part0020.html#ch04en117e">117</a></span> Later that year, Rayner wrote an essay in a white newspaper in which he openly despaired, \xe2\x80\x9cPolitics has nothing to offer the negro.\xe2\x80\x9d Since some of their race aspired to become \xe2\x80\x9cprotagonist[s] in politics,\xe2\x80\x9d he bemoaned, African Americans generally were deceived by \xe2\x80\x9cutopian promises\xe2\x80\x9d and plunged into political activism, only to find their \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical opportunities circumscribed\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmanhood proscribed.\xe2\x80\x9d The word choice of \xe2\x80\x9cprotagonist\xe2\x80\x9d fit his political record and echoed his irate letter to the brewers earlier that year, indicating that he saw himself as a na\xc3\xaff whose political activism against prohibition did not elevate his race, but rather degraded it further by provoking white backlash.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en118" href="part0020.html#ch04en118e">118</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Unable or unwilling to blame themselves for their defeats, white drys blamed African Americans for their political failures in the 1910s.

Park put the issue baldly regarding the 1912 US Senate race between a wet and a dry: the wet candidate \xe2\x80\x9cwanted the lower class of negroes and Mexicans to rule,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cthe white Americans\xe2\x80\x9d would support his opponent, Morris Sheppard. Predictably, Sheppard won the race and soon became prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s champion in the US Senate.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en121" href="part0020.html#ch04en121e">121</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">These white attacks on Blacks were not merely rhetorical but corresponded to increasing intimidation that reduced turnout. Whereas the populist movement brought out about 85 percent of the African American vote in Texas in 1896, the African American vote had plummeted to just 23 percent turnout in 1902, even before the poll tax was implemented. By the time voters approved statewide prohibition in 1919, their share was smaller still.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en122" href="part0020.html#ch04en122e">122</a></span> Voter suppression by white drys against minorities proved ruthlessly effective.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Public pressure to suppress African Americans\xe2\x80\x99 participation in politics contributed to the court case that doomed the wet coalition in Texas. A suit filed in January 1915 by the office of Texas attorney general B. F. Looney demanded the brewers pay over $21 million for violating the state constitution and various laws, both antitrust laws and laws limiting the use of corporate money to influence politics and elections. The <span class="italic">Abilene Daily Reporter</span> in 1915 highlighted the sensational claim that the brewers paid poll taxes for wet voters, \xe2\x80\x9cespecially negroes.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en123" href="part0020.html#ch04en123e">123</a></span> In a January 1916 court settlement, the seven Texan brewers admitted to the charges, paid fines of about $290,000 (far less than the initially proposed sum), and forfeited their business charters for two years.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en124" href="part0020.html#ch04en124e">124</a></span> With that stroke, the wet coalition was all but finished in Texas.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en125" href="part0020.html#ch04en125e">125</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">While Black votes shrank, prohibition swept the remaining dry southern states. In February 1913, the Arkansas legislature passed virtual statewide prohibition and blocked a referendum attempt to reverse it; prohibition took effect the next year. In October 1913, the Tennessee legislature passed laws to strictly enforce their Four Mile Law, which essentially enacted prohibition statewide. South Carolina had opted in 1907 for a dispensary system that limited alcohol distribution, brought in revenue to the government, and slowed dry sentiment in the state. Nevertheless, on September 14, 1915, over 70 percent of South Carolinians voters favored prohibition, and the law went into effect on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day 1916. While by 1912 the Virginia House voted overwhelmingly to submit an \xe2\x80\x9cenabling act\xe2\x80\x9d to allow a statewide vote on prohibition, the state senate beat the measure by 24 to 16. Finally, in 1914, a tie-breaking vote in the Virginia Senate approved the vote, which was held on September 22, 1915, and resulted in a majority of 30,365 for the drys. Prohibition took effect over a year later, on November 1, 1916.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en126" href="part0020.html#ch04en126e">126</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">By 1918, Florida went dry by popular vote while Texas turned dry by a vote of the state legislature, and Texas voters added prohibition to the state constitution by referendum in 1919.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en127" href="part0020.html#ch04en127e">127</a></span> By 1918, every southern state except Louisiana had statewide prohibition. Without a powerful white interest group to protect them in the late 1910s, African Americans\xe2\x80\x99 influence on prohibition elections in the South shrank to near insignificance. Gin Crow\xe2\x80\x94the rise of prohibition in the South at the expense of Black political engagement\xe2\x80\x94had triumphed at last.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Conclusion</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">The racial dynamics of prohibition were complex and sometimes ironic. White prohibitionists increasingly sought to affirm a racial hierarchy, particularly keeping African Americans in their place. Meanwhile, embattled and desperate brewers, to save themselves, politically empowered those same minorities who were being oppressed. African Americans chose from a variety of responses to advance their individual and collective fortunes, switching from dry to wet according to the shifting circumstances, and significantly affected prohibition elections by their actions, especially from 1910 to 1912. These cases demonstrate the power of interracial wet coalitions in the early Jim Crow period across the South, from Deep South to the upper South and from the far western South to the far eastern South. Those cases also show that African Americans\xe2\x80\x99 votes against prohibition were integrally tied to their efforts to preserve their citizenship rights, particularly the right to vote.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The alcohol industry was a powerful ally of African American enfranchisement, but the alliance was self-interested for all parties and short-lived due to internal divisions and outside pressures. As Barry Hankins has aptly stated, \xe2\x80\x9cCulture wars create odd bedfellows and ever-shifting alliances,\xe2\x80\x9d and preachers like Rayner lived out these shifting alliances.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en128" href="part0020.html#ch04en128e">128</a></span> African Americans forestalled statewide prohibition in several states for years.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch04en129" href="part0020.html#ch04en129e">129</a></span> The diverse coalition demonstrated the potential power of interracial politics in the South into the 1910s and briefly rekindled allegedly moribund African American political activism more than a decade into Jim Crow.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The losses of prohibition votes across the region by the late 1910s resulted in a powerful backlash that effectively silenced Black votes in statewide elections for decades. The decline in Black voting power for prohibition coincided with a rise in support for white women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage in enough southern states\xe2\x80\x94Texas, Arkansas, and Tennessee\xe2\x80\x94to enshrine the Nineteenth Amendment in the US Constitution. By 1920, white women gained suffrage in the South while Black men lost it. Throughout the 1920s, the enforcement of prohibition laws in the South disproportionately targeted Black Americans, reflecting and reinforcing the prejudices of white drys. Law-and-order rhetoric flowed from the lips of lawless racial terrorists in the Ku Klux Klan and anti-Catholic firebrands like Governor Sidney Johnston Catts of Florida. Gin Crow not only worsened racial inequality through selective enforcement but also stirred up ugly religious prejudices as well, particularly against Catholic Americans. For the 1920s, the forces of racial and religious intolerance had the law firmly on their side.</p>\n</body></html>\n'</p>
