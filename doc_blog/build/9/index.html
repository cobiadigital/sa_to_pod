This handbook illustrates how specific needs and force-free training methods are inherently connected, opening the door for conversations with other pet professionals and with clients. In addition, it elucidates how to inspire professionals to invest in a total program of care and training. By design, this handbook encourages collaboration between force-free pet professionals to refer to and support other force-free professionals to achieve optimal well-being for the whole dog. The Hierarchy of Dog Needs (HDN) graphic is used in speaker presentations at veterinary conferences and lectures at local humane societies and pet expositions.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Developing Training Plans</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The <i>Do No Harm</i> handbook identifies primary, secondary, and other problems affecting dogs and guides the reader on the assessment, treatment, and training path. It accounts for both dog and client needs, helping the pet professionals or pet parents to create a comprehensive training plan. This training handbook also provides an outline for class and private consulting.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Increasing Workflow</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Review The Hierarchy of Dog Needs infographic with your client and take notes about problem areas; this will assist in uncovering additional training needs. Creating a <i>to-do list</i> helps the professional to set the training focus on the specific needs of their client and dog, providing a comprehensive plan for both.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">When working up the pyramid, identify unmet and under-met needs and areas of particular interest or concern. Working down the list of training methods on the left side of the pyramid outlines how to address behavioral issues. Details explaining each method are also discussed in Part 1. The remainder of the handbook contains information regarding the application of these methods, which may be used in any order or combination. In this manner, pet professionals may establish the required number of sessions needed for a comprehensive approach to address the underlying motivations of problem behaviors and identify the various contexts where such behaviors occur.</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image4.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Using The Hierarchy of Dog Needs</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The <i>Do No Harm</i> handbook is designed for use in media and the development of professional treatment plans.

Each section can also serve as a standalone topic for a presentation tailored to the interest of a sub-population of dog lovers. For example, one topic of interest is the need for proper temperature control and how to avoid hyperthermia in the summer, and hypothermia in winter. Or a speaker for a breed rescue group might create a presentation on brachycephalic airway obstruction from the section of the handbook devoted to the need for air.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Examples for Pet Bloggers and Television Interviews</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The topics in this<i> </i>handbook and The Hierarchy of Dog Needs make excellent blog material. Force-free advocates can easily use the HDN to explain dog needs and force-free training during television spot presentations.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Examples for Classes</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent"><i>Do No Harm</i> <i>Management and Best Force-free Practices</i> methods illustrated by The Hierarchy of Dog Needs are a great segue laying a foundation for force-free training.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Consider developing a lesson guide of basic skills using the <i>Do No Harm Dog Training Handbook </i>as a foundation, using The Hierarchy of Dog Needs infographic as a handout for discussion during class. Use the training techniques and trainer \xe2\x80\x9csecrets<i>,\xe2\x80\x9d</i> such as capturing, luring, shaping, linking, and real-life reinforcement to teach force-free best practices in the context of teaching name response, sit, down, wait/stay, come, and leash-walking. Trainers who teach classes may rearrange the topic material and teach a basic skill in each class. Referencing the HDN throughout lessons with clients helps to emphasize the importance of meeting needs and learning force-free methods. The goal for any class is empowering clients to use force-free methods for problem-solving when training issues arise when you are not there in class to guide them. Include a copy of the HDN in take-home training packets.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Examples for Private Consultations</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Review the HDN infographic with your client during the first consulting session. Assess training needs and identify the methods you will use from the force-free training methods chart on the left side of the handout. Help address unwanted behavior with explanations of differential reinforcement, counterconditioning, and desensitization methods. Take notes on a master copy. Private consultants can identify behavioral problems needing attention and lead to the development of a treatment plan to determine which basic skills are missing from a family\xe2\x80\x99s repertoire to help the troubled dog and client. Address the needs and topics you feel most competent and comfortable teaching. For example, the client may want recommendations on nutrition and exercise. A conversation on <i>Emotional Needs</i> and trust often reveals fearful or aggressive behavior only a qualified behavior consultant can safely and adequately address. A discussion on <i>Social Needs</i> and attachment may uncover a separation/attachment issue or disorder associated with pet parents, or with other dogs in the family.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Another idea is to create a poster of the HDN<i> </i>for your facility or classroom wall. Have a print company create an unaltered, uncropped (as is) poster from a print-ready file available to force-free advocates from the author.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Examples for Veterinarians</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs (HDN) includes gentle veterinary care as an essential biological health need. As the primary contact professionals, veterinarians are in a position to make the greatest impact on the physical and psychological well-being of the dogs under their loving care. Veterinarians can take a leadership role with pet parents and other pet-related professionals in the animal welfare and force-free movement by using The Hierarchy of Dog Needs<i> </i>and the accompanying<i> Do No Harm Dog Training and Behavior</i> <i>Handbook.</i> They are encouraged to share The Hierarchy of Dog Needs with colleagues, patients, trainers, and at speaking engagements, such as in seminar presentations for veterinary conferences. Veterinarians are encouraged to refer only to force-free/<i>Do No Harm</i> dog trainers and consultants. (See Chapters 1 and 8, Gentle Veterinary Care.)</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Examples for Rescues and Shelters</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Make your rescue or shelter truly force-free by adding a copy of the HDN infographic to the take-home packet with each newly adopted dog. Post a laminated copy on the gate to each dog\xe2\x80\x99s kennel as a reminder to everyone who enters of how to use force-free handling and training techniques with the focus on meeting emotional needs and decreasing stress. Ensure that all management, staff, volunteers, and foster parents have access to a copy of the infographic as a means to educate everyone connected to your adoption agency. Post a copy on your website and social media sites.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Examples for Groomers</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Groomers may blog or offer presentations on the benefits of gentle grooming, the importance of proper hygiene, removal of fur nests that may serve as havens for bacteria, and proper nail clipping to prevent long nails from impeding a dog\xe2\x80\x99s natural walking gait or the structural functions of the spine. Use the handbook to develop a training packet that includes information about pet grooming provided in the gentle grooming sections to help the client\xe2\x80\x99s dog learn to tolerate and even enjoy grooming.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Examples for Responsible Breeders</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Provide a copy of The Hierarchy of Dog Needs infographic in the educational and guidance packets of each new pet parent and discuss the needs and do no harm training practices you want to guarantee to your adoptees.</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent_SB"><b><i>Note:</i></b><i> The reproduction, use, or modification of the Hierarchy of Dog Needs</i><span style=" font-style: italic; font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: super;">\xc2\xae</span><i> is strictly prohibited in any product sold for profit where the primary value of the product is the reproduction itself, such as on t-shirts or coffee mugs.</i></p>\n<p id="future_directions_in_research__law__and_the_role_of_celebrities" class="P_Subheader_-16">Future Directions in Research, Law, and the Role of Celebrities</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The time has come to chart a new course. <i>Do No Harm </i>principles and ethics are fast becoming the gold standard of care throughout the dog training profession. Scientists, legislators, and celebrities are urged to take a clear and unwavering position against the physical and psychological harm our dogs suffer, pioneering the cultural change essential in creating truly dog-friendly societies. Worldwide, progressive zoos and sanctuaries have moved away entirely from using punitive and other aversive methods, even when working with large and potentially dangerous animals.</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 90%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image6.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Normal">Dog bites are a serious and growing public safety issue and it is well-documented in scientific literature that inflicting pain is frequently a cause of aggressive behavior. Bite incidents may result from the direct administration of shock (Polsky, 2000). Aggression is not the only emotional disturbance stemming from punitive and aversive training methods. According to an article in the <i>Journal of Veterinary Behavior, </i>\xe2\x80\x9cGood Trainers: How to Identify One\xe2\x80\x9d (Overall et al., 2006), investigators placed shock collars, prong collars, and choke collars at the top of the list of equipment that causes anxiety, fear, and arousal, which often contributes to an increase in aggression. A growing number of governments in progressive animal-welfare sensitive nations ban the use of these devices on pet dogs.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Canine research scientists are encouraged to take a leadership role in the ethical treatment of companion animals. Evidence illustrates there is no place for shock, prong, choke, or other aversive variables in companion animal research. The rationale against the use of shock and positive punishment is well established in scientific literature. Dr. Karen Weigle (2019), clinical psychologist, affiliated with the University of New Hampshire spoke out on shock saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThis has gone on for this long because this is a population who cannot adequately speak for themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d Who will speak for the dogs? If not us, who? If not now, when? Professional positions opposing the use of aversives in dog training are based on both a sophisticated academic grasp of the neurochemical and behavioral mechanisms at play, and a desire to promote animal welfare in a civilized world (Michaels, 2015d). The hallmarks of leadership in science highlight the detrimental effects that painful devices and practices have on our companion animals. The advent of the Pet Professional Guild (PPG) gives medical professionals, research scientists, and other pet professionals a clear option for affiliation with an international, science-oriented organization. PPG members subscribe to No Shock, No Pain, No Choke, No Fear, No Pain and No Physical Force in dog training. It is understood that science cannot take a stand\xe2\x80\x94but scientists can.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Scientists can easily design research studies that <i>do no harm,</i> thus supporting the<i> </i>instrumental and necessary steps leading to a ban on shock devices used with pet dogs. A survey using the extensive Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ) database (Serpell, 2020), or a separately designed survey, exploring the co-relational relationship between shock training and bites would be of practical value to scientists, animal welfare advocates, trainers, and the public. A survey study based upon a collection of statistics from veterinarians on the injuries and deaths from choke and prong collars would inform and illustrate the true extent of the problem using these devices.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Scientific presentations have real world impact on audiences, and moreover, on our companion animals. Pet professionals from an array of dog-related fields often incorporate these scientific interpretations into their practices and hold them up as a gold standard. New evidence-based practices are the driving force in social commitment to animal welfare policy legislation and the subsequent enforcement of sanctions prohibiting intentional harm to dogs. Scientists who adopt a clear and ethical stand on dog handling and training can help drive social change and shape laws governing animal welfare legislation. Governmental representatives will look closely at what scientists have to say about shock, prong, choke, and dominance training practices. The adaptation of ethics driven science into law puts to rest the unwarranted justification of the use of painful devices and training methods.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Celebrity impact on cultural change is also a powerful and a much-needed force for good. The dog-loving celebrity community can be leading spokespersons for <i>Do No Harm</i> training methods. Celebrities can affect the well-being of dogs across the globe with just a few, clear, and well-spoken words about dog training methods. Employing force-free dog trainers and encouraging the production of truly dog-friendly television shows and films will further endear fans to stars and their pets.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Together a commitment to strengthening animal welfare laws and regulations based upon dog-friendly ethics will bring about a transformation\xe2\x80\x94a sea change in dog training that is long overdue. Increasing penalties for dog abuse and neglect, and developing regulation in the field of dog training ensures trainer competency and a <i>do no harm</i> ethic for dog-related activities. This will accomplish our collective goal. It is incumbent upon each of us to take a clear and unwavering stand on these issues by adopting a force-free ideology concerning the care and welfare of our dogs.</p>\n<div id="hoopla-highlight-container"></div></body>\n</html>'</p>
