Marking the emergence of the force-free age in the field of dog training, The<i> </i>Hierarchy of Dog Needs<span style=" font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: super;">\xc2\xae</span><i> </i>is a logical and progressive paradigm whose time has come. The Hierarchy of Dog Needs (HDN)<i> </i>is a wholistic system of care that takes a clear and ethical stand on dog welfare needs and dog-training methods and devices. The HDN is a novel adaptation of renowned psychologist Abraham Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Hierarchy of</i> (human) <i>Needs</i> that emphasizes strengths, positivity, free will/choice, and a belief in the wholeness of animal nature (Maslow, 1943). Research shows that when biological needs, safety needs, and belongingness needs are met for social animals, they are far less likely to display abnormal behavior. The Hierarchy of Dog Needs is supported by scientific evidence as demonstrated in this handbook and makes no apologies for embracing protective ethics concerning our beloved dogs.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs infographic and this handbook provide teaching tools for all types of industry professionals and pet parents to use as a force-free alternative to the more conventional but dated teaching paradigms currently available. Anyone who interacts with or studies dogs, or any animal for that matter, can use it successfully. The HDN lists dog needs hierarchically but the levels are fluid rather than static. Once basic needs have been assessed and met, the training methods may be used in <i>any order</i> of choice, dependent upon the situation, context, and expertise of the handler.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs is a guide to animal wellness and <i>Do No Harm Dog Training. </i>The Hierarchy of Dog Needs<i> </i>was created as a guide to standards of basic care in dog welfare needs and best force-free training practices. The HDN is in use internationally by veterinarians, veterinary behaviorists, dog trainers (including working-dog and police-dog trainers), groomers, shelters, rescues, animal welfare advocates, and pet parents. The HDN has been translated into French, Spanish, Portuguese, Danish, Chinese, German, Estonian, Korean, Greek and Arabic to date, with many more requests awaiting translation.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs is a tool for animal wellness and serves as an essential companion to the <i>Do No Harm Dog Training Handbook. </i>HDN <i>Force-free Training</i> <i>Needs </i>methods and this handbook may be used for both common behavioral problems and the most challenging issues, such as housetraining, loose leash-walking, excessive barking, separation anxiety, fear, dog-dog aggression, human aggression, resource guarding, and more. It can help to identify the primary, secondary, and other problems affecting the dog and help guide the path of training.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">There is an increasingly strong dog-human bond in society and it makes sense that a more dog-friendly, dog-needs paradigm was needed and thus developed. Too often basic needs are not met or are under met. Dog needs are not considered in punitive or \xe2\x80\x9cbalanced\xe2\x80\x9d training approaches where the focus is on punishing unwanted pet dog behavior and not on dog welfare. <i>Do No Harm</i> training makes dogs\xe2\x80\x99 lives better because it is more effective, safer, and has longer lasting effects. <i>Do No Harm</i> is truly dog friendly.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs infographic is not intended to be a treatise on learning theory<i>.</i> Science has examined many different types of learning that include: Habituation, sensitization, desensitization, positive reinforcement, positive punishment, negative reinforcement, negative punishment, extinction, imitation, mimicry, and social learning. In other teaching paradigms, understanding behavior uses Skinnerian-related quadrants as a means to categorize response frequency. Placing every behavior response into a quadrant is not always helpful or the best approach to understanding emotional and behavioral modification and training needs. Only those methods that are physically and emotionally safe for dogs are included on the HDN and taught in the handbook.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The HDN pyramid infographic was designed to be a stand-alone guide covering as much critical territory for dog welfare and training in a one-page format as feasible. The HDN addresses as many primary needs and force-free training methods as possible, however, no infographic can convey all things to all pet professionals. Scientific advisor Dr. Luis Suoto Soubrier aptly points out, \xe2\x80\x9cThe main message and the paramount goal of The Hierarchy of Dog Needs are clear. By introducing further nuances and provisos, even after writing an exhaustive (and exhausting to read) set of rules, we would still, unavoidably, be simplifying reality anyway\xe2\x80\x9d (L. Suoto Soubrier, personal communication, 2015).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The joys, challenges, and responsibilities of pet parenting involve loving care and fit well with The Hierarchy of Dog Needs model. Of primary importance is the enhanced relationship the pet parent nurtures with their dog by using the HDN. Nurturing and developing social skills and confidence in your dog sets the stage for optimal well-being, using force-free training, instead of instilling fear and potentiating aggression.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal"><i>Do No Harm</i> is fast becoming the gold standard of care throughout the dog-training field. Pet parents and professionals are now applying emotional and behavioral modification methods using the <i>Do No Harm </i>model. The time has come to chart a new course making responsible dog training method the best practice.</p>\n<p id="i__the_do_no_harm_ethical_codes" class="P_Subheader_-16">I. The Do No Harm Ethical Codes</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Ethics are at the very heart of <i>Do No Harm Dog Training and Behavior Handbook</i> and the HDN. The embedded <i>Do No Harm</i> ethical code follows force-free, aversive-free, punitive-free training methods alone as best practices. To stem the tide of animal abuse in the dog training industry, canine behavior consultants are raising their voices in regulating practices in the field of dog training.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Pet Professional Guild (PPG) (2020c) is the first international, independent certifying dog training organization to take a clear, uncompromising, antithetical position on the use of shock, prong, choke, dominance, pain and fear-based methods in dog training. Members are fully vetted and must conform to a non-negotiable ethical code of conduct and standards. Members forfeit their membership status for violations of the ethical standards. We need more of these organizations to help protect and defend our dogs\xe2\x80\x99 well-being.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Professional organizations caring for and treating sentient beings all have ethical codes guiding their members and detailing acceptable standards of care.

Aversive techniques are especially injurious to fearful and aggressive patients and often suppress signals of impending aggression, rendering any aggressive dog more dangerous. Aversive techniques include prong (pinch) or choke collars, cattle prods, alpha rolls, dominance downs, electronic shock collars, lunge whips, starving or withholding food, entrapment, and beating.

No single model of behavior can comprehensively understand, explain and predict behavior. The Hierarchy of Dog Needs<i> </i>however<i> </i>is multi-modal, multi-dimensional, and based upon a number of behavioral models providing a more complete and eclectic representation of learning and behavior than any one of the classic models of behavior do alone. Below are some popular <i>schools of thought</i> and theories about the nature of behavior.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">The Behavioral Model</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The Behavioral Model attributes behavior to the environment. The environment drives behavior through antecedents and postcedent consequences. Behavioral Analysis is based upon the <i>if, then contingency</i>. Behavior is learned, that is conditioned through</p>\n<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">\n<li class="P_ListItem"><p class="P_ListParagraph"><i>Classical Conditioning:</i> Associations learned by pairing one stimulus\xe2\x80\x94the antecedent, to another stimulus</p>\n</li>\n<li class="P_ListItem"><p class="P_ListParagraph_1"><i>Operant Conditioning: </i>Reinforcement or punishment also known as consequences or postcedents</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p class="P_Normal">More often than not both classical conditioning and operant conditioning occur simultaneously and are inextricably linked with each other. However, these two types of learning are typically spoken of independently so students and trainers may more easily understand the concepts of behaviorism. With this clarity, practitioners can identify the underlying principles leading to the formulation of a plan for treating a specific problem, behavior, or emotion. The researchers most notably responsible for developing these representational systems of behavior are research scientists Ivan Pavlov and B. F. Skinner.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">This model theorizes that a dog bites a person because the dog has been reinforced or punished for biting, or the dog associates the person with something that previously caused an involuntary physiological response and/or a learned aversive response.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">The Affective Neuroscience Model</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The Affective Neuroscience Model of behavior attributes behavior to functions of the brain modulated by hormones. The emotional systems model theorizes that environment, behavior, and emotion cannot be isolated from each other, resulting in the activation of multiple emotional and behavioral systems in any given schema. Some of the most notable researchers in this area include Charles Darwin, Jaak Panksepp, and Joseph E. Ledoux.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">This model theorizes that a dog bites a person because the dog is experiencing fear, panic, or rage on the neurological and hormonal levels.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">The Ethological Model</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The Ethological Model of behavior attributes behavior to evolutionary adaptive traits with a focus on field studies in natural environments. The identification of <i>Modal Action Patterns (MAP)</i>, inherited tendencies to make specific and complex responses to specific environmental stimuli, helping scientists to understand behavior. Some of the most notable researchers in this area include Charles Darwin, Konrad Lorenz, Niko Tinbergen, and Simon Gadbois.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">This model theorizes that a dog bites a person because it is adaptive to survival to bite when threatened or to compete for resources.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">The Medical Model</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The Medical Model of behavior attributes behavior to wellness or the lack thereof. Veterinarians and veterinary behaviorists build their treatment plans based upon this model.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">This practice theorizes that a dog bites a person because the dog has a pathological condition or is in pain.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">The Biological Model</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The Biological Model of behavior attributes behavior to genetics or DNA, determined by heredity and breeding.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">This model theorizes that a dog bites a person because of the propensity for aggression acquired through the dog\xe2\x80\x99s lineage.</p>\n<p id="iii__maslow_s_hierarchy_of_needs_-_the_third_force_in_behavior" class="P_Subheader_-16">III. Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s Hierarchy of Needs\xe2\x80\x94The Third Force in Behavior</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Students of psychology are familiar with <i>The Hierarchy of </i>[human]<i> Needs.</i> The Hierarchy of Dog Needs is a novel variation of renowned psychologist, Abraham Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s Hierarchy of Needs, adapting a human model of behavior to fit dogs. Similar needs occur in all species.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Animal models of human needs are traditionally used in research where the results and conclusions are extrapolated to humans to help us understand disease and develop treatments in medicine and behavior. Pavlov developed his theories of classical conditioning using dogs as his subjects in research. Skinner developed his theories of operant conditioning using pigeons as his research subjects. The field of comparative psychology explores cross-species comparisons, including those between humans and animals (Tinbergen, 1963).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Maslow, disenchanted with the popularized behaviorist paradigm of his time, cofounded the school of thought in psychology called <i>humanism</i>, the <i>Third Force</i> that emerged subsequent to psychoanalysis and behaviorism (Leahey, 2001). During the summer of 1938, Maslow conducted anthropologic research on a Blackfoot Native American reservation that is believed to have inspired him to theorize a new understanding of the fundamental features of human nature (Taylor, 2019)<i>.</i></p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Humanistic psychology emphasizes strengths, positivism, choice, and a belief in the wholeness of animal nature. In Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s own words: \xe2\x80\x9cSelf-actualized people have the wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder and even ecstasy, however stale these experiences may have become to others\xe2\x80\x9d (Maslow, 1943, pp. 370\xe2\x80\x93396). Does this not definitively describe what we often observe in our dogs? We witness our dogs taking great joy in simple things, over and over again. Taking a (w)holistic view of the sentient dog, The Hierarchy of Dog Needs combines both wholeness and behaviorist templates for wellness and emotional and behavioral modification understanding that both mental events and previously reinforced learned behaviors are causal. Humanism asserts that the present and the future and the past influence us.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Following on the heels of Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s work and others, the former President of the American Psychological Association, and renowned research scientists, Martin Seligman, became the face of <i>Positive Psychology</i> (Seligman, 2020). He called for an alternative to psychology\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crelentless focus on the negative\xe2\x80\x9d and for research into growth, mastery and drive. Today, much research and many academic textbooks explore topics including well-being, the science of happiness, and peak performance. Seligman\xe2\x80\x99s most famous work on <i>learned helplessness</i> (Seligman, 1972) demonstrated that dogs that had previously learned that escape from shock was impossible, would not even attempt to escape once escape was on option. His breakthrough research shows that <i>mental events are causal, even in our dogs</i> (Seligman cited in Schultz &amp; Schultz, 2008).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Maslow further developed his theory in <i>Motivation and Personality</i>, highlighting the significance of relationships<i> </i>(Maslow, 1954). <i>The Hierarchy of </i>[human]<i> Needs</i> remains a very popular framework in secondary and higher education psychology instruction and research. The nature of our relationships with our dogs deserves more attention, thus introducing this adaptation to dog care and training is a unique pleasure.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Dogs have the opportunity to reach an optimal state of well-being when all their needs are met. This is the singular objective of The Hierarchy of Dog Needs principles and procedures, standards of care and best practices. All needs highlighted in the Hierarchy of Dog Needs are interconnected. Needs are similarly dynamic in humans. Researchers find those whose needs for safety and belongingness are met are far less likely to display distraught and disordered behavior than those who have not had these needs satisfied (Schultz &amp; Schultz, 2008).</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent_SB"><b>Note:</b> While a pyramid has become a popular way to represent <i>The Hierarchy of </i>[human]<i> Needs</i>, Maslow himself never used a pyramid to illustrate his levels in any of his writings on the subject.</p>\n<div id="hoopla-highlight-container"></div></body>\n</html>'</p>
