The day before, Heflin, who represented Alabama in the US House, had introduced a bill to extend Jim Crow segregation to the District of Columbia\xe2\x80\x99s streetcars. Just before the shooting, Heflin was on a streetcar in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital on his way to give a lecture at a Methodist church on \xe2\x80\x9cTemperance\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which in that context meant prohibition\xe2\x80\x94when two Black men boarded the car. One of those men, Louis (or Lewis) Lundy, produced a flask, at which point Heflin berated him for drinking in front of a white lady. Lundy \xe2\x80\x9creplied that he\xe2\x80\x99d take a drink if he felt like it.\xe2\x80\x9d Everyone left the car at the next stop except Heflin, the unnamed white woman, Lundy, and an unnamed Black man. When Lundy rose to take a drink, Heflin engaged him, and Lundy grabbed him by the lapel. Heflin drew a pistol, hit Lundy on the head with the butt, shoved and kicked Lundy off the car, and fired two shots at him. One of the shots hit Lundy in the neck, and another ricocheted into a white bystander, Thomas McCreary.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en1" href="part0020.html#ch03en1e">1</a></span> While Heflin was briefly arrested, he was soon bailed out and charges against him were soon dropped.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">In one sense, this behavior fit with Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s lifelong advocacy of white supremacism. As a delegate to the convention for the 1901 Alabama Constitution, Heflin successfully pushed for measures to disfranchise Black voters, stating: \xe2\x80\x9cGod Almighty intended the negro to be the servant of the white man.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en2" href="part0020.html#ch03en2e">2</a></span> While serving as secretary of state for Alabama in 1903, he publicly supported white men who had Black men fraudulently arrested and then forced them to perform slave labor through convict leasing, arguing that such efforts helped maintain white supremacy. As he represented his state in the US House from 1904 to 1920, he routinely spouted racist vitriol.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en3" href="part0020.html#ch03en3e">3</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">More broadly, Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s vigilante action weaves together southern prohibition and Jim Crow in several ways. First, the incident highlights how prominent white southern drys used their power to promote white supremacism and Jim Crow laws, such as the streetcar law Heflin had introduced the day before the shooting. While Heflin, like many other \xe2\x80\x9cstates\xe2\x80\x99 rights\xe2\x80\x9d southerners, later opposed <span class="italic">federal</span> prohibition, speaking on \xe2\x80\x9cTemperance\xe2\x80\x9d at a Methodist church implied his dry stance at the local and state levels. Other prominent white drys across the South likewise linked prohibition to white supremacism. Tennessee\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition \xe2\x80\x9cmartyr\xe2\x80\x9d Edward Ward Carmack, Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cFather of American Prohibition\xe2\x80\x9d Richmond Pearson Hobson, and Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s Southern Methodist Bishop James Cannon also numbered among white drys who advocated both prohibition and strict racial hierarchy.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Second, the shooting suggested how fears connecting racial disorder and gender, which inspired Jim Crow laws, also helped the cause of prohibition. Heflin attributed the incident to a Black man drinking alcohol in the same streetcar as a white woman, an allusion to fears of drunk Black men assaulting white women and to Black criminality generally. White drys had openly argued that legal segregation and banning alcohol would keep Black men docile and so protect the virtue of white women, thus preventing the need for lynchings. The notion of protecting white women\xe2\x80\x99s honor from inebriated Black men was a key component of prohibition advocacy in the South.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The shooting also reflected how white churches supported the values of Jim Crow and prohibition. While Heflin did not explicitly connect his white-supremacist violence to his faith, he was a white Christian on his way to a Methodist church to lecture on temperance when it happened. Instead of leading him to turn the other cheek or at least stay his hand, Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s convictions whipped him into a nearly lethal rage at the sight of a Black man who violated his racial, gender, and alcohol taboos. While it might be tempting for believers to claim Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s behavior was out of step with \xe2\x80\x9ctrue\xe2\x80\x9d Christian faith, religious and racial convictions are strands of a contingent and experiential fabric and are demonstrated by their fruits. Far more important than what Heflin himself did is how white Christians around the South responded. The lack of a serious rebuke from his peers indicated their tacit consent\xe2\x80\x94if not nodding approval\xe2\x80\x94for his near-murder of a Black man who had the temerity to sip alcohol in front of a white woman on a streetcar. White churches in the South and around the nation thus showed more support for a white champion of Jim Crow and prohibition than the Black man he nearly shot to death.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Support for Heflin was not limited to churches. Regardless of party or home region, Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s white colleagues in the US House heaped praise and sympathy on him. Southern white members excused his \xe2\x80\x9cimpetuous temperament\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chis views on the race question.\xe2\x80\x9d Within minutes of Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s arrest, offers to pay his $5,000 bond came from House members representing parts of Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North and South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and most of the Alabama districts.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en4" href="part0020.html#ch03en4e">4</a></span> Other Democrats offering to pay Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s bail came from beyond the former Confederacy, including Charles Ferris Booher of Missouri and John Geiser McHenry of Pennsylvania. Sympathy for Heflin and regret for the incident came \xe2\x80\x9cfrom all quarters,\xe2\x80\x9d including the Republican Speaker of the House, Joseph Gurney Cannon of Illinois.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en5" href="part0020.html#ch03en5e">5</a></span> Even the white man Heflin accidentally shot shared his white supremacism. When an ambulance took Lundy, the also-wounded McCreary ordered a separate carriage, since he refused to ride with a Black man to the hospital.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en6" href="part0020.html#ch03en6e">6</a></span> McCreary also dropped charges when Heflin offered to pay his hospital bills.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en7" href="part0020.html#ch03en7e">7</a></span> Whites regardless of party or region saw little need to punish Heflin for nearly killing a Black man who defied the racial order.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The ties between prohibition and Jim Crow were not limited to extraordinary incidents like this but extended to changing laws around the South. On New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, 1908, the first statewide prohibition law in the South went into effect. Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s state legislature voted overwhelmingly for the measure in July 1907. The Georgia House voted 139 to 39 in favor on July 30; then the Senate approved the amended bill 34 to 7, and the governor promptly signed it.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en8" href="part0020.html#ch03en8e">8</a></span> It seemed fitting that the state whose capital, Atlanta, was the first major city in the South to opt for prohibition in 1885 would also be the first southern state to go dry.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">As far as Black voters were concerned, however, the 1885 and 1907 measures could not have been more different. While white drys and white wets competed for African American votes in the 1880s, Jim Crow laws in the 1890s and 1900s had marginalized Black voters in nearly all major political contests. Prohibitionist whites were particularly insistent on suppressing Black votes, which they blamed for their failures in decades past. As statewide prohibition laws spread throughout the South in the 1900s and 1910s, the dry movement became increasingly white and ever more entwined with Jim Crow. This sharp turn to Jim Crow\xe2\x80\x94and prohibitionist \xe2\x80\x9cGin Crow\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in the South can best be properly understood by way of a brief detour into the greatest interracial political movement across the region between the 1870s and the 1960s: populism. While not directly bearing on prohibition, populism reveals how interracial politics rose, nearly triumphed, and crashed dramatically, providing the immediate context for the white-supremacist alliance between drys and advocates of Jim Crow.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Political Prelude: Populists</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">After the failure of interracial cooperation in the prohibition contests of the 1880s, the next major effort at multiracial political coalitions in the South was the Populist Party or People\xe2\x80\x99s Party. According to Gerald H. Gaither, historians have generally fallen into three schools of thought on how Black men interacted with the populist movement. The progressive school of the 1920s and 1930s treated Black voters as tools of whites, more inclined to sell their votes than engage in the political process to achieve their own interests. The consensus school of the 1950s, however, emphasized the class solidarity of Black and white farmers and optimistically posited that interracial politics could have succeeded if events had only gone differently. A more pessimistic recent school since the 1990s has emphasized institutional racism over class and concluded that interracial politics between relatively marginalized Blacks and relatively more secure whites was doomed to failure. While surveying these three perspectives, Gaither argues that southern populism is \xe2\x80\x9ca many-faceted crystal that does not fit easily into any set historiographical formula.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en9" href="part0020.html#ch03en9e">9</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The Populist Party grew out of the Farmers\xe2\x80\x99 Alliance, a farmers\xe2\x80\x99 cooperative whose white leaders initially sought to win over Bourbon Democrats to support their cause. Founded in 1874 or 1875 in Lampasas County, Texas, the alliance sought to help small-time farmers through the hard times brought on by declining cotton prices. Charles William Macune grew the organization but sought to keep it \xe2\x80\x9ca strictly white man\xe2\x80\x99s nonpolitical secret business association.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en10" href="part0020.html#ch03en10e">10</a></span> Macune, a Democrat, denied Blacks membership in the Texas Alliance and sought to pressure Democratic politicians to advance farmers\xe2\x80\x99 interests, not turn it into a political party.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The alliance spread west, and by 1887 the Texas Alliance had fused with the Louisiana Farmers\xe2\x80\x99 Union, forging the National Farmers\xe2\x80\x99 Alliance and Co-operative Union of America, commonly called the Southern Alliance. By 1888, the enlarged Southern Alliance merged with another farmers\xe2\x80\x99 cooperative, the Agricultural Wheel. Two years earlier, in 1886, the Colored Farmers\xe2\x80\x99 Alliance (CFA) had been founded in Texas as a secret society working for the interests of Black farmers following the philosophy of self-help and racial uplift. By 1888, the white farmers of the Southern Alliance formally endorsed collaboration with the CFA, which aspired to represent the region\xe2\x80\x99s 4.5 million African American farmers. The CFA, for its part, depended on economic aid from whites to support most of its state exchanges to help farmers struggling with low crop prices. Even before the Populist Party was founded, there was limited interracial cooperation in the alliance organizations that preceded it.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en11" href="part0020.html#ch03en11e">11</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Despite the rhetoric of shared self-interest for Black and white farmers, however, most African Americans had difficulty making common cause with white farmers for racial and economic reasons. The racial order of the South prevented integration of the alliance organizations. Most southern white farmers refused to treat African Americans as their social equals, and most Black farmers preferred Black-only organizations to work for their common racial interest and to avoid sabotage by white interlopers. Despite the nonpartisan nature of the alliances, they did address lightning-rod political issues along racial lines. In 1890, white Southern Alliance members denounced a \xe2\x80\x9cForce Bill\xe2\x80\x9d that would have allowed federal supervision of southern elections, while the CFA endorsed it. While whites and Blacks both supported the Subtreasury Plan of federal aid to farmers with loans, crop storage, and price controls, the CFA also backed more radical measures such as a socialistic single tax to move land ownership to communal control, while the Southern Alliance preferred a more modest graduated income tax.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Economically, the vision of shared interests by all farmers in the South was little more than fanciful fiction. Many white farmers in the Southern Alliance were small landowners who were primarily interested in raising crop prices while most Black farmers were tenant farmers chiefly concerned about raising wages. By 1888, the Southern Alliance proposed to support the Colored Alliance to mobilize some while still upholding the doctrine of racial segregation. While several state branches of the CFA supported strikes by Black workers in 1891, the white Southern Alliances denounced the strikes. When push came to shove, differences of race and class divided southern farmers deeply.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en12" href="part0020.html#ch03en12e">12</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Nonetheless, the Populist Party, or People\xe2\x80\x99s Party, emerged from the alliance movement in the South due to Bourbon Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to implement alliance policies. Despite the efforts of Macune and others to keep the alliance nonpartisan, some supported a \xe2\x80\x9cPeople\xe2\x80\x99s ticket\xe2\x80\x9d that swept out Bourbon Democrats in Comanche County, Texas, in the summer of 1886. Local People\xe2\x80\x99s Party elections won in a few races until 1890, when several alliance organizations in the West and South endorsed the newly organized Populist Party. Texans such as James \xe2\x80\x9cCyclone\xe2\x80\x9d Davis (white) and John Rayner (Black) eventually backed the new party as well. While Davis argued that the Populist Party platform came from the Democratic principles of Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson, Rayner appealed to African Americans disillusioned with the Republican Party.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en13" href="part0020.html#ch03en13e">13</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Some African Americans in the South considered joining the Populist Party due to long-standing tensions with the Republican Party. While white Radical Republicans supported Black citizenship rights in the 1860s and 1870s, most white Republican elites soured on protecting African Americans. The Liberal Republican split-off in 1872 denounced federal interventions in the South that protected African American citizens from white terrorism, and the contested 1876 election resulted in a Republican president, Rutherford B. Hayes, who declined to send in federal troops when white supremacists violently seized power in Louisiana, Florida, and South Carolina. After white-supremacist Democrats took firm control of southern state governments in the late 1870s, some white Republicans reasoned that they needed to embrace white supremacy to have a chance at power in the region. These \xe2\x80\x9clily-white\xe2\x80\x9d Republicans clashed with \xe2\x80\x9cBlack and tan\xe2\x80\x9d Republicans, who embraced interracial politics. By the 1890s, most white Republicans, even in much of the South, had taken an ambivalent or hostile position toward Black political rights.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en14" href="part0020.html#ch03en14e">14</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">For their part, some African Americans in the South had taken steps to distance themselves from the Republican Party in the 1880s. Robert Reed Church Sr., the South\xe2\x80\x99s first Black millionaire and a saloon owner, ran unsuccessfully for Memphis\xe2\x80\x99s Board of Public Works in 1882 on the People\xe2\x80\x99s Ticket and Independent Ticket\xe2\x80\x94but not as a Republican.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en15" href="part0020.html#ch03en15e">15</a></span> John Rayner, a saloon operator and Republican politician in North Carolina in the 1860s and 1870s, dropped his GOP affiliation when he moved to Texas in the 1880s, preferring prohibition activism to partisan politics. Some African Americans even joined the Democratic Party. From 1878 to 1890, for example, twenty-one African Americans were elected as Democrats to the South Carolina House of Representatives. Nonetheless, most Black southerners still identified with the Republican Party in the 1890s.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en16" href="part0020.html#ch03en16e">16</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Despite its multiracial base, Populist leaders, both white and Black, insisted that they fought merely for political equality, not social equality. One white Populist in Alabama declared that the party was \xe2\x80\x9cfurther from . . . social equality, than any ballot box stuffer alive,\xe2\x80\x9d and their opposition to racial mixing did \xe2\x80\x9cnot relax at the going down of the sun.\xe2\x80\x9d Rayner, the son of a white father and a Black mother, went so far as to deflect white southerners\xe2\x80\x99 fear of miscegenation onto the Democrats. He often opened his Populist stump speeches before white audiences by remarking on his light skin and declaring that \xe2\x80\x9cthis is what he had received from the Democrats\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94even though his father was a Whig, not a Democrat.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en17" href="part0020.html#ch03en17e">17</a></span> While the Populist Party welcomed white and Black votes, it also upheld racial segregation.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Rayner\xe2\x80\x99s support of the Populists embodied the hope of many Black southerners that it could be their best chance for political and economic progress in the South since Reconstruction. He seized the chance to become the greatest African American \xe2\x80\x9corator, organizer, and political strategist\xe2\x80\x9d for the Populists from 1892 to 1898.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en18" href="part0020.html#ch03en18e">18</a></span> Rayner worked for negligible pay, planting African American Populist Party organizations and delivering powerful speeches for their cause throughout East Texas. As during the 1887 prohibition contest, he openly offered political advice to white comrades and attracted respect from white crowds. He also helped shift most African Americans\xe2\x80\x99 support from the Republicans to the Populists. Though just 20 percent of African Americans supported the Populists in 1892, 50 percent backed them four years later. For his efforts, Rayner was elected as the only African American delegate to the Texas Populists\xe2\x80\x99 state executive committee in 1896. As historian Charles Postel puts it, Rayner was \xe2\x80\x9cthe most prominent\xe2\x80\x9d African American in the movement nationally.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en19" href="part0020.html#ch03en19e">19</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">In the 1890s, Populists rose to prominence in state and federal elections throughout the South (<span>see <a class="nounder" href="part0015.html#tab03">table 3</a></span>). Georgian politician Tom Watson was elected to Congress in 1890 as an Alliance Democrat, loyal both to the party of white supremacy and to alliance issues, yet he faced furious opposition and defeat from Bourbon Democrats in 1892. In Texas, Populist gubernatorial candidate Thomas Nugent in 1894 received over 150,000 votes, or 36 percent of the total, displacing the Republicans as the most serious threat to Bourbon rule in the state. In 1894, Alabama Populists helped elect three men to the US House. Truman Heminway Aldrich, a Republican, ran for Congress with Populist backing against Democrat Oscar Underwood, while two outright Populists, Albert Taylor Goodwyn and Milford Wriarson Howard, also ran. Goodwyn and Aldrich lost due to fraud, though they both successfully challenged the results and took their seats for a few months from 1896 to March 1897. Howard, meanwhile, won clear majorities in 1894 and 1896, serving two terms.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en20" href="part0020.html#ch03en20e">20</a></span> Populists gained real political power throughout the South in the 1890s.</p>\n<p class="table-title" id="tab03"><b class="calibre2">Table 3.</b> Populists in the South, 1890s</p>\n<p class="images"><img src="../images/00017.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre3"/></p>\n<p class="x-txtf">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The Populists\xe2\x80\x99 greatest success in the South, however, was in North Carolina, but that story ended in tragedy for interracial politics. In 1894, Populists and Republicans combined forces to win most seats in both houses of the state legislature for a \xe2\x80\x9cFusion\xe2\x80\x9d government. No fewer than six Populists were elected to Congress between 1894 and 1898, and Marion Butler, a powerful figure in the state and national populist movement, became the only member of his party from the South elected to the US Senate, serving from 1895 to 1901. North Carolina Populists also helped deliver the governor\xe2\x80\x99s mansion to a Republican, Daniel Lindsay Russell, the only non-Democrat to serve as governor in that state between the 1870s and 1970s. African Americans took some seats in the upper and lower chambers of the state legislature, and George Henry White won a congressional seat in 1896 and 1898, becoming the only Black congressman at the time and the last African American in Congress from the South until the 1970s.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en21" href="part0020.html#ch03en21e">21</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Despite these initial successes, white supremacism overturned these gains by violence in 1898. Fomenting fears of \xe2\x80\x9cblack rule\xe2\x80\x9d and race riots, Democratic leaders such as newspaperman Josephus Daniels and Furnifold McLendel Simmons helped organize Red Shirt clubs to achieve Democratic victory through intimidation, murder, and fraud, sweeping the 1898 state legislative elections. When Wilmington, North Carolina, the state\xe2\x80\x99s largest city with a Black majority, elected a Republican mayor and city council in 1898 despite the reign of terror, white supremacists took violent action. They burned down the city\xe2\x80\x99s Black-run newspaper, murdered at least a dozen people, forced the Republican officeholders to resign at gunpoint, and prompted thousands of African Americans to leave the city\xe2\x80\x94enough to turn the city from majority-Black to majority-white, which it remains to the present day. As a reward for coordinating the white-supremacist coup, Simmons in 1901 took a seat in the US Senate, where he served for thirty years, and set up his powerful \xe2\x80\x9cSimmons machine\xe2\x80\x9d to reward his allies.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en22" href="part0020.html#ch03en22e">22</a></span> Despite this crushing defeat, North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s Fusionists in the 1890s, like Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s Readjusters before them, had threatened conservative Democratic rule in the post-Reconstruction South in ways that the Republican Party alone could not.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Outside of North Carolina, 1896 brought doom for the multiracial Populist coalition as an effective opposition to the Democratic Party in the South. The national People\xe2\x80\x99s Party supported William Jennings Bryan, the same presidential candidate as the Democrats that Rayner and other Black voters so hated. Many white Populists placed white supremacy above their economic interests and voted Democratic, while African Americans split their vote between the Populists and the Republicans. That year also signaled the return of white supremacy in Rayner\xe2\x80\x99s Robertson County by fraud, intimidation, and violence. As in the 1894 Texas elections, white Democrats committed massive fraud, buying votes outright from Mexican Americans and deceiving illiterate African Americans to vote for the Democratic ticket. By 1898, the Populist Party in Texas was effectively dead, and with it the dream of a multiracial coalition overthrowing white-only rule. After one last brief flirtation in 1902 with a Populist campaign that never materialized, Rayner and most other African Americans were finished with Populist politics.

The Populists launched the first serious attempt at interracial politics in the South since Reconstruction in the late 1890s, but Democrats used fraud, intimidation, and violence to defeat it. As the twentieth century dawned, so did new restrictive voting measures to suppress turnout from the supposedly unworthy citizens\xe2\x80\x94particularly (but not limited to) African Americans, who had provided essential support to the Populists. White Populists eventually rejoined the Democratic Party and infused it with a fiery commitment to exclude African Americans from politics entirely. As early as 1890, Edward R. Cocke, who led the Virginia Farmers\xe2\x80\x99 Alliance, petitioned to repeal the Fifteenth Amendment to stop Black voting. As Charles Postel put it, \xe2\x80\x9cThe white Farmers\xe2\x80\x99 Alliance was a driving force behind the new Jim Crow segregation laws adopted across the South.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en25" href="part0020.html#ch03en25e">25</a></span> While initially seeking Black votes, most white Populists eventually joined with white Democrats to advance white supremacy by disfranchising and segregating from their Black former allies through a series of laws collectively called \xe2\x80\x9cJim Crow.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p class="x-a">Jim Crow</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Repressive laws targeting African Americans in the former Confederacy began with the Black Codes. Pioneered by Mississippi\xe2\x80\x99s legislature in late 1865, in the aftermath of the Thirteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s abolition of racial chattel slavery, Black Codes were adopted in southern states by former Confederates eager to salvage some form of legal white supremacism. The codes included vagrancy laws to force unemployed Black men into harsh labor, apprenticeship laws to force underage Black children into quasi-slavery, and other laws calculated to reduce Black freedoms. Though these laws were overturned by Congressional Reconstruction in 1867, white southern Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 ambition to treat Black Americans as second-class citizens by law emerged with a vengeance with Jim Crow.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Soon after the end of Reconstruction, white Democrats experimented with various disfranchisement measures to achieve white-only rule.

A variety of literacy test, this law mandated eight distinct boxes for different offices in the election and required voters to put their ballots in the right box\xe2\x80\x94on which instructions had to be read\xe2\x80\x94or otherwise have their vote disqualified. While voting officials could aid voters with their choice, African American voters had little reason to trust white Democratic officers to direct them honestly. Even more nefarious was the law\xe2\x80\x99s lesser-known provision that all eligible voters had to <span class="italic">reregister</span> by June 1, 1882, or else be forever banned from voting. Given the broad powers of local officials in determining a voter\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility and an arduous appeals process, the disfranchisement aspect of the Eight Box Law was even more sinister than its eponym. Despite objections from Black legislators like state senator Thomas E. Miller of Beaufort and litigation by the US attorney for South Carolina, Samuel A. Melton, the state legislature followed Governor Hugh Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s advice to pay $10,000 to cover the legal fees of poll workers who were sued for abuse of Black voters\xe2\x80\x99 rights.

This iteration not only created a separate box for each office and invalidated votes in the wrong box, but it only allowed voters only five minutes to choose the correct boxes.

These laws divided into two major categories: racial segregation and voter suppression. While racial social divisions had existed even during Congressional Reconstruction and considerable Black voter suppression had been achieved by fraud and terrorism since 1877, neither social division nor disfranchisement was systematically enshrined by legal code in the late 1880s. Jim Crow was, in short, an attempt to secure and advance white supremacism by law.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en30" href="part0020.html#ch03en30e">30</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Popular accounts of Jim Crow often focus on segregation in schools, bathrooms, drinking fountains, and other public accommodations, yet the Jim Crow statutes most relevant to prohibition concerned disfranchisement. Some of these laws\xe2\x80\x94such as poll taxes, literacy tests, and grandfather clauses\xe2\x80\x94were not explicitly racial, but their intent and application excluded African Americans from meaningful political participation.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The most widespread and obvious attempt at voter suppression was the poll tax (<span>see <a class="nounder" href="part0015.html#tab04">table 4</a></span>). Ostensibly levied to provide funds for education, taxes on all voting-age men had existed long before the Civil War, but they were often laxly enforced. Arkansas, for example, authorized a poll tax in its first state constitution in 1836 as well as its Confederate constitution in 1861. Reconstruction-era states reined in poll taxes. For example, Arkansas\xe2\x80\x99s 1868 Reconstruction constitution stated: \xe2\x80\x9cThe levying of taxes by the poll is grievous and oppressive; therefore the general assembly shall never levy a poll tax excepting for school purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en31" href="part0020.html#ch03en31e">31</a></span> Poll taxes were a flat fee and therefore regressive, disproportionately burdening the poor, particularly African Americans. As Reconstruction\xe2\x80\x99s interracial politics fell to white Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 campaigns of terror and fraud, new state constitutions opted to include poll taxes. Under this new order, poll taxes were more strictly enforced and receipts were required to vote.</p>\n<p class="table-title" id="tab04"><b class="calibre2">Table 4.</b> Select Voter Suppression Laws by Year and State, 1875\xe2\x80\x931902</p>\n<p class="images"><img src="../images/00018.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre3"/></p>\n<p class="x-txtf">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The poll taxes in this era took two forms: opt-in and cumulative. Of the two, opt-in poll taxes allowed voting-age men to pay a flat rate to vote for the next year or six months, depending on the state. This option allowed voters to opt out of paying the poll tax for years\xe2\x80\x94at the cost of not being able to vote\xe2\x80\x94and then opt in for another voting period for a flat rate. Cumulative poll taxes, however, added up over time if left unpaid. Voters who skipped poll taxes for several years had to pay the cost of those years as well. In some states, the cost was capped at up to three years\xe2\x80\x99 worth of poll taxes, while others demanded payment for <span class="italic">every</span> year since a man turned twenty-one and thus became eligible to vote. Because cumulative taxes made a more onerous burden on the poor, both Black and white, they were more reliable at suppressing voter turnout than opt-in taxes.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">A pioneering state in poll taxes was Georgia, which adopted one as early as 1877. Georgia imposed a cumulative tax of $1.50 per person, requiring each person to pay a sum for every year since the law went into effect or since they turned twenty-one. Even earlier than Georgia was Virginia, which implemented its first round of poll taxes via constitutional amendment in 1876 at the behest of the Conservative Party (as Democrats were briefly called there), but a cross-racial coalition of Readjusters repealed the poll tax requirement in 1882.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en32" href="part0020.html#ch03en32e">32</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Populism\xe2\x80\x99s resurrection of interracial politics in the 1890s prompted white-supremacist Democrats across the South to take extreme measures, including poll taxes, to maintain their grip on power. Florida took the lead in 1889 with a $2.00 annual opt-in poll tax, followed later that year by Tennessee. While Tennessee\xe2\x80\x99s 1870 constitution permitted a poll tax, even the renowned white supremacist and former US president Andrew Johnson opposed it for its obvious potential to disfranchise poor whites, and a poll tax was not implemented by the state legislature until 1889. Still, Tennessee\xe2\x80\x99s poll tax was opt-in on an annual basis, lessening the potential to fully eliminate poor white voting. Mississippi followed suit with a $2.00 opt-in tax in its 1890 state constitution, while Arkansas adopted a $1.00 opt-in tax in 1892. While most Populists sought to repeal those poll taxes in the 1890s, the enforcement of them (along with blatant fraud) made it all but impossible for Populists to win major victories in those states.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en33" href="part0020.html#ch03en33e">33</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">A few straggler states joined the poll tax movement around the turn of the century. In North Carolina, after the Red Shirts\xe2\x80\x99 takeover in 1898, systemic disfranchisement of Black voters was the next logical step. As Josephus Daniels, a proud supporter of the Red Shirts and purveyor of baseless racial fearmongering in 1898, claimed, \xe2\x80\x9cThe greatest folly and crime in our national history was the establishment of negro suffrage immediately after the [Civil] War.

Of course, the satisfaction requirement provided ample latitude for discrimination.

A few sensational episodes reinforced the widespread idea among southern white Americans that alcohol turned otherwise docile Africans into rapacious, murderous monsters. \xe2\x80\x9c<span class="small-caps2">WHISKEY MAKES BLACK SLAYER THIRST FOR BLOOD</span>\xe2\x80\x9d reads the headline concerning Clarence Cooley, who murdered Johannes Hansen and Louis Teten after drinking two bottles of beer and a pint of whiskey. The article begins with a saloon that \xe2\x80\x9csoaked Clarence Cooley\xe2\x80\x99s black flesh with whiskey, fired his docile brain with the fumes of alcohol, and sent him forth to slay.\xe2\x80\x9d The article ends with words of warning from Cooley: \xe2\x80\x9cLet booze alone.

The article makes this explicit when it states the price of Cooley\xe2\x80\x99s drink and adds: \xe2\x80\x9cThat was the price of three human lives.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en60" href="part0020.html#ch03en60e">60</a></span> The story inspires the reader to take responsibility for the poor \xe2\x80\x9cnegroes\xe2\x80\x9d who cannot help but kill once they have a few drinks. White drys did not see African Americans as three-dimensional people but as objects of scorn and pity to be protected from booze.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">That story parallels an incident in Shreveport, Louisiana, where Charles Coleman, an African American man, was convicted and punctiliously hanged (legally) for raping and murdering a fourteen-year-old white girl, Margaret Lear. Coleman had been drunk. A reporter speculated (apparently without proof) that Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s drink had been \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Cock Vigor Gin,\xe2\x80\x9d an actual brand of cheap gin sold to African Americans that featured a scantily clad white woman.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en61" href="part0020.html#ch03en61e">61</a></span> According to a prohibitionist mindset, alcohol was to blame. By the same token, white drys argued that taking away alcohol would improve Black behavior and therefore reduce lynchings. In February 1928, <span class="italic">Home and State</span> printed a clipping stating that lynchings decreased due to prohibition, advancing the logic that proper legislation keeps alcohol out of the hands of Blacks and so keeps them docile.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en62" href="part0020.html#ch03en62e">62</a></span> For white drys, prohibition was yet another means to control the bodies of Black men.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">While one may interpret white evangelicals\xe2\x80\x99 prohibition advocacy as trying to reduce racial violence, it may equally be viewed as another form of racial control. Joe Coker contends that white evangelicals in the South promoted prohibition as a \xe2\x80\x9cpreemptive solution\xe2\x80\x9d to lynching which contributed to a \xe2\x80\x9cdecline in racial rhetoric.\xe2\x80\x9d Even so, he admits that white evangelicals were often \xe2\x80\x9cembracing and utilizing\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing racial attitudes of the region . . . for the advancement of prohibition.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en63" href="part0020.html#ch03en63e">63</a></span> In other words, even white drys\xe2\x80\x99 well-meaning efforts at avoiding unnecessary violence grew from an underlying commitment to white supremacism, and they deliberately used white-supremacist rhetoric to win over their white neighbors to prohibition.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">White media justified not only lynchings but other forms of extralegal violence against Black men with alcohol by depicting them as deviants particularly prone to criminal behavior. Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s shooting of Lundy in 1908 was not technically an attempted lynching because it was not done by a group of three or more people,<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en64" href="part0020.html#ch03en64e">64</a></span> but the incident illustrates this principle. As happened over a century later when unarmed Black men were shot by whites, some media outlets depicted the Black victim as a drug-tainted criminal and the white shooter as acting in self-defense. One <span class="italic">Washington Times</span> article, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cWounded Negro Has Bad Record in Police Court,\xe2\x80\x9d noted that Lundy \xe2\x80\x9chas been arrested time and again on charges of every character, and during the last few years much of his time has been spent in jail.\xe2\x80\x9d Offenses included carrying concealed weapons, petty larceny, and various incidents of drunkenness, disorderly conduct, and \xe2\x80\x9cviolating the police regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d The newspaper called Lundy \xe2\x80\x9csurly,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca source of constant trouble to the police,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cone of the most persistent lawbreakers and one of the most desperate negroes with whom the police have ever come in contact.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en65" href="part0020.html#ch03en65e">65</a></span> The paper also reported that Lundy was drunk or high when he reached the hospital and that it required six men to subdue him with anesthetic\xe2\x80\x94a clear parallel to latter-day warnings of drugs giving Black men unnatural strength. Heflin refused to speak to the press, but his authorized spokesman, fellow Alabama congressman Henry De Lamar Clayton Jr., claimed that Lundy was \xe2\x80\x9cunder the influence of gin, cocaine, or some other drug.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en66" href="part0020.html#ch03en66e">66</a></span> Such reports described Lundy as both \xe2\x80\x9cuppity\xe2\x80\x9d and under the influence: a not-so-subtle warning that Black men with alcohol threatened law and order, a standard white argument for prohibition.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">While major newspapers declined to interview the two Black men involved (or the white woman present) in Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s attempted homicide, close analysis of white accounts sufficiently undermines Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s self-defense claim. Clayton claimed that Heflin fought because the two Black men had planned to attack him. This theory made little sense, since the other Black man had earlier \xe2\x80\x9cattempted to take the flask away from\xe2\x80\x9d Lundy, showing that he was trying to defuse the situation by complying with Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s demand. While the <span class="italic">Times</span> stated that Heflin shoved and kicked Lundy off the car, South Carolina representative James Edwin Ellerbe claimed Heflin had scuffled with <span class="italic">both</span> men, who cursed Heflin \xe2\x80\x9cafter reaching the ground,\xe2\x80\x9d suggesting that Heflin had thrown them both off the car. Then Heflin fired while both men were on the ground\xe2\x80\x94hardly a position requiring Heflin to shoot in self-defense.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en67" href="part0020.html#ch03en67e">67</a></span> To the media of that time, however, the violence deserved no closer scrutiny: the Black man on drugs inherently deserved excessive force from a white elected official. White drys promised greater white control of such Black men.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">White drys sought to control not only Black men but also Black women who challenged the racial order. When Ida B. Wells denounced the lynchings of three African Americans in Memphis in 1892, Edward Ward Carmack, a prominent dry media personality, used his position as editor of the <span class="italic">Memphis Commercial</span> newspaper to malign her as \xe2\x80\x9cthe Black wench.\xe2\x80\x9d In what might reasonably be described as incitement to riot, Carmack called for retaliation against Wells for daring to oppose the system of racial terror they represented. An angry white mob answered his call and destroyed the offices of her paper, the<span class="italic"> Free Speech.</span> Fortunately, Wells was out of town at the time of the attack and so was unharmed, but the incident and subsequent death threats prompted her to live in exile in the North for thirty years. By inciting a mob against Wells, Carmack literally called for the destruction of <span class="italic">Free Speech</span> in the defense of white supremacism.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en68" href="part0020.html#ch03en68e">68</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Rather than hurting his reputation, the incident helped Carmack\xe2\x80\x99s political rise, and by 1908 he became the leader of the dry faction in the Democratic primary for Tennessee governor. He was only narrowly defeated by Malcolm R. Patterson, who led the state Democratic Party\xe2\x80\x99s wet faction. While Patterson easily won the general election, Carmack returned to working as a newspaper editor. In that role, Carmack launched several libelous attacks against a rival newspaperman, Duncan Brown Cooper. On November 9, 1908, when Cooper and his son encountered him on a Nashville street, Carmack opened fire. Carmack wounded Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s son, and Cooper shot Carmack dead. Carmack, who lived in vitriol and violence, became known as a \xe2\x80\x9cmartyr\xe2\x80\x9d for the dry cause and earned a posthumous statue in front of the Tennessee statehouse from 1925 until its removal in 2020.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en69" href="part0020.html#ch03en69e">69</a></span> Violence on behalf of white supremacism and one\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chonor\xe2\x80\x9d was a feature, not a bug, for southern white drys.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The \xe2\x80\x9cFather of American Prohibition,\xe2\x80\x9d Alabama US representative Richmond Pearson Hobson, likewise linked prohibition to white-supremacist views in his most famous dry speeches to Congress. In his famous \xe2\x80\x9cThe Great Destroyer\xe2\x80\x9d speech on the House floor in 1911, he spoke about \xe2\x80\x9c<span class="small-caps2">THE CURSE OF THE RED MAN AND BLACK MAN\xe2\x80\x9d</span> and argued: \xe2\x80\x9cIf a peaceable red man is subjected to the regular use of alcoholic beverage, he will speedily be put back to the plane of the savage.\xe2\x80\x9d The answer for such problem was, in his Progressive mind, using government force to coerce right behavior: he remarked approvingly that \xe2\x80\x9cThe Government long since recognized this and absolutely prohibits the introduction of alcoholic beverage into an Indian reservation.\xe2\x80\x9d Hobson extended such thinking to African Americans as well: \xe2\x80\x9cIf a negro takes up a regular use of alcohol beverage, in a short time he will degenerate to the level of a cannibal.\xe2\x80\x9d Hobson conceded that liquor was not only a problem for racial minorities but also could affect \xe2\x80\x9cthe noblest white men\xe2\x80\x9d regardless \xe2\x80\x9chow high the stage of evolution.\xe2\x80\x9d Even this supposedly more-evolved white man with corresponding \xe2\x80\x9cgreat self-control,\xe2\x80\x9d who is \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderate, tenderhearted, who would not willingly harm an insect, will be degenerated by regular use of alcoholic beverage to the point where he will strike with a dagger or fire a shot to kill with little or no provocation.\xe2\x80\x9d The description of shooting to kill with little cause seemed an apt description of Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s attack on Lundy in 1908, a sober white man assaulting a Black man having alcohol. However, for white southern drys such as Hobson, alcohol was the prime culprit for such danger, and nonwhites were particularly \xe2\x80\x9ccursed\xe2\x80\x9d with the vulnerability to descend to \xe2\x80\x9csavagery\xe2\x80\x9d and lose their \xe2\x80\x9cself-control, self-respect, the sense of honor, [and] the moral sense.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en70" href="part0020.html#ch03en70e">70</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">In a similar speech in 1914 entitled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Truth about Alcohol,\xe2\x80\x9d Hobson repeated and expanded on these white-supremacist themes. He claimed that alcohol has made \xe2\x80\x9ctwice as many slaves, largely white men, today than there were black men slaves in America at any one time.\xe2\x80\x9d In addition to minimizing the extreme terror and torture experienced by real slaves, he literally did not count the suffering of enslaved women and children in his \xe2\x80\x9cblack men slaves\xe2\x80\x9d calculation.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en71" href="part0020.html#ch03en71e">71</a></span> He also bemoaned a \xe2\x80\x9cgrowing degenerate vote directly due to liquor\xe2\x80\x9d which menaced not only large cities but also the whole nation.

His second speech, while also claiming that liquor could take the same effect on white men (though, \xe2\x80\x9cbeing further evolved it takes [a] longer time to reduce him to the same level\xe2\x80\x9d), now omits the old reference to drunken white men stabbing and shooting.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en74" href="part0020.html#ch03en74e">74</a></span> Hobson, prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s greatest promoter in the US House and an outspoken Progressive from the South, emphasized white suffering from alcohol, stirred fears of \xe2\x80\x9cdegenerate\xe2\x80\x9d voters, increasingly stressed the threat of violence against whites from drunken African Americans and Amerindians, and muted his earlier concerns of violence committed by drunken whites. In short, the South\xe2\x80\x99s most prominent dry linked prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s success in the 1910s more and more to control of nonwhite bodies and votes.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Many drys, including Mexican Americans and Black Americans, linked prohibition to the rule of \xe2\x80\x9cbetter\xe2\x80\x9d social classes. The racial order articulated by Texan drys in <span class="italic">Home and State</span> assumed at least as much cultural and class superiority as racial superiority. Various articles in the paper argued against \xe2\x80\x9cthe low negro and Mexican vote,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cMexican and ignorant negro,\xe2\x80\x9d and the like.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en75" href="part0020.html#ch03en75e">75</a></span> However, many drys distinguished between \xe2\x80\x9clow\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbetter\xe2\x80\x9d minorities, especially regarding Mexicans and African Americans. A 1912 <span class="italic">Home and State </span>article entitled \xe2\x80\x9cOur Mexican \xe2\x80\x98Citizens\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d focused on \xe2\x80\x9cthe ignorant and unpatriotic Mexicans known as the \xe2\x80\x98Greaser Class.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d The author recognized that \xe2\x80\x9camong our Mexican citizenship there are many first-class men and women who are educated, intelligent, and loyal to our government and its situations,\xe2\x80\x9d but in the rest of the article \xe2\x80\x9cno reference whatever is made to that [first] class.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en76" href="part0020.html#ch03en76e">76</a></span> In the context of a dry paper, such terms as \xe2\x80\x9ceducated, intelligent, and loyal\xe2\x80\x9d were synonymous with prohibition while \xe2\x80\x9cignorant and unpatriotic\xe2\x80\x9d signified opposing it. Mexican Americans may have been generally regarded with contempt by white Texans, but some dry whites saw middle-class dry Mexican Americans as respectable, in contrast with the wet majority.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Similarly, some African American clergy gained white favor by backing prohibition. Before white drys had opted for prohibition via Jim Crow, a good number of leading African Americans were dry. Rayner, Bishop Turner, and the Rev. J. W.

They followed in the tradition of Booker T. Washington, who tried to uplift his race by deferring to the southern racial order while seeking advancement through gradually expanding economic and practical educational opportunities.

Edwin DuBose Mouzon, a relatively progressive Southern Methodist bishop from Texas who promoted prohibition vigorously, confessed to his fellow bishop James Cannon Jr. in 1919 that \xe2\x80\x9cthe negro is not in point of morals, or education, or religion, the equal of the white man, and to place him in the church on a position of equality would be a wrong to the negro and to the church.\xe2\x80\x9d For his part, Cannon, who led the Virginia ASL to dry the state by 1916, expressed similar views. He described \xe2\x80\x9cthe negroes as a people\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ca child race\xe2\x80\x94immature, not fully developed\xe2\x80\x9d and justified extralegal action against \xe2\x80\x9cbrute beasts . . . whose brutal assaults on white woman bring on rioting and bloodshed.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en82" href="part0020.html#ch03en82e">82</a></span> White evangelical drys may have occasionally welcomed Black support but believed whites should rule the church as well as the state.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Drying the Southland</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Given the increasingly clear connection between white churches, white supremacy, and prohibition, most southern states turned dry within a few years, from 1908 to 1915. Georgia went dry on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day in 1908, and throughout that year several southern states opted to begin prohibition on January 1, 1909. After Birmingham\xe2\x80\x99s Jefferson County went dry by nearly eighteen hundred votes on Oct. 28, 1907, Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s legislature decided that the writing was on the wall and voted for statewide prohibition that November. Mississippi\xe2\x80\x99s legislature followed suit in February 1908.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en83" href="part0020.html#ch03en83e">83</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">North Carolina distinguished itself by becoming the first southern state to opt for statewide prohibition by popular vote in 1908. The dry side brought together such unlikely allies as Governor Robert Broadnax Glenn and US Judge Jeter Connelly Pritchard, who had taken opposite sides on disputes about railroad monopolies. Nearly all of the state\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic congressmen also joined the drys. So, it was unsurprising that on Tuesday, May 26, 1908, North Carolinians voted for prohibition by a margin so large that newspapers predicted its victory before watching official results come in. With North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s vote, half of the eight states in the nation that approved statewide prohibition were in the South\xe2\x80\x94most if one includes the new state of Oklahoma.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en84" href="part0020.html#ch03en84e">84</a></span> While only three states nationwide (none of them southern) had statewide prohibition in effect at the start of 1907, within two years the South had leaped to the forefront of the movement.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The next several years demonstrated rapid progress for drys in the South. As with Mississippi and Alabama, North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s dry law went into effect on January 1, 1909, and the year saw more successes for the drys across the South. On January 19, the Tennessee legislature overrode the governor\xe2\x80\x99s veto to ban alcohol within four miles of schools and ban alcohol production in state, which took effect the next year. In August 1909, a South Carolina election enacted partial statewide prohibition, allowing counties to opt out, and only six counties opted to stay wet with government-run alcohol dispensaries.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en85" href="part0020.html#ch03en85e">85</a></span> While a prohibition amendment to Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s constitution was defeated by the voters in November 1909, the state remained officially dry, even if dry laws were not consistently enforced.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en86" href="part0020.html#ch03en86e">86</a></span> <span>Tables 5 and 6</span> give a fuller timeline for the success of prohibition in the region.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">One constant throughout these campaigns for white drys was control of African Americans. As Lee L. Willis put it, \xe2\x80\x9cRestricting blacks\xe2\x80\x99 access to alcohol was a theme that ran through the temperance and prohibition campaigns in Florida.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en87" href="part0020.html#ch03en87e">87</a></span> Even in free-wheeling New Orleans, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Gibralter [<span class="italic">sic</span>] of the liquor traffic in the South,\xe2\x80\x9d where laws regulating saloons were \xe2\x80\x9ceverywhere openly violated,\xe2\x80\x9d prohibition laws reeked of Jim Crow\xe2\x80\x99s doctrine of racial separation.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en88" href="part0020.html#ch03en88e">88</a></span> Louisiana\xe2\x80\x99s Gay-Shattuck law, which regulated liquor licenses and ostensibly went into effect in January 1, 1909, prohibited the sale of alcoholic drinks to whites and Blacks within the same building. Though drys complained that the law was frequently ignored in New Orleans and other wet towns, the law on its face made plain that, as far as southern white drys were concerned, prohibition included racial separation.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch03en89" href="part0020.html#ch03en89e">89</a></span></p>\n<p class="table-title" id="tab05"><b class="calibre2">Table 5.</b> Timeline for Statewide Prohibition across the US South, 1907\xe2\x80\x931920</p>\n<p class="images"><img src="../images/00019.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre3"/></p>\n<p class="table-source"><span class="italic">Sources:</span> Cherrington, ed., <span class="italic">Anti-Saloon League Year Book</span> (1908\xe2\x80\x9319); \xe2\x80\x9cDry,\xe2\x80\x9d <span class="italic">Prescott,</span> AR, <span class="italic">Daily News,</span> July 31, 1907, 1; \xe2\x80\x9cProhibition for Alabama Passes,\xe2\x80\x9d <span class="italic">Prescott,</span> AR, <span class="italic">Daily News,</span> November 21, 1907, 1; \xe2\x80\x9cAlabama Prohibition,\xe2\x80\x9d Newbery, SC, <span class="italic">Herald and News,</span> November 22, 1907, 3; \xe2\x80\x9cProhibition in Mississippi,\xe2\x80\x9d <span class="italic">Newport,</span> VA, <span class="italic">News,</span> February 8, 1908, 3; O\xe2\x80\x99Daniel, <span class="italic">Crusaders, Gangsters, and Whiskey,</span> 17, 23; <span class="italic">Alabama Official and Statistical Register, 1911,</span> comp.

After the dramatic failure of attempts at interracial cooperation in the 1880s, white drys increasingly tended towards the exclusion of racial minorities from politics by intimidation and Jim Crow laws. Unabashed race-baiting grew increasingly effective in advancing prohibition in the South.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">However, white drys encountered significant opposition in the 1900s and early 1910s. Christians of all races continued to resist Gin Crow\xe2\x80\x99s infringement of their God-given liberties. Black voters defied the Jim Crow laws that limited their voting rights and worked together with brewers to inflict stinging defeats on the drys. This multiracial and religiously infused wet coalition won a string of statewide votes that humiliated drys from one end of the South to the other during the early days of Jim Crow.</p>\n</body></html>\n'</p>
