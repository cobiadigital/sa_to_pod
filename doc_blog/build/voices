Dogs are completely dependent upon us to provide a sufficient amount of high-quality, biologically appropriate food. They cannot go to the grocery store or open the refrigerator to retrieve what their body is craving! Taking a look at the world from a dog\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, allows us to better appreciate our responsibility to provide biologically appropriate nutritious food. Improper diet and poor-quality food may cause behavioral problems and medical issues in dogs. Poor quality food invites allergies and illness. Many medical and behavioral problems are directly affected by diet, so keeping a beloved dog physically and temperamentally fit by meeting their nutritional needs is essential. You want your dog to thrive, so provide high-quality dog food.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">While experts disagree about nutrition, most will agree that any diet you choose must be nutritionally balanced. Sadly, \xe2\x80\x9c. . . much of the research supporting clinical pet diets does not undergo peer review and is never published in full journal form. Whereas obtaining patent rights to protect intellectual property is understandable, the field as a whole will benefit only if data are published\xe2\x80\x9d (Deng &amp; Swanson, 2015, p. 825). Veterinary nutritionists do agree that a poor diet is the biggest obstacle to achieving overall canine health. It is a daunting task to stay up to date on the latest nutritional theories, brands, and recalls. It is important to take nutritional recommendations from reliable sources whose opinions are not influenced by commercial interest as much as possible. If your dog is healthy there are many choices in biologically appropriate diets. However, if there is illness or disease you will want to follow the recommendations of your trusted veterinarian.

A balanced diet requires a variety of healthy meats and veggies. Most vegetables and some fruits can and should be a part of your dog\xe2\x80\x99s diet. For many pet parents, that means finding a few reliable brands and rotating between whole protein sources such as chicken, beef, and salmon, within and between brands. Transition between brands or protein sources over the course of a week or two, gradually adding the new food to the old. Continuously feeding the same food may create allergies and nutritional deficiencies.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Dr. Karen Becker, a leading integrative veterinarian specializing in nutrition recommends a carefully planned biologically appropriate diet for you dogs. She tells us,</p>\n<p class="P_Block_Quote"><i>And while nutritionally balanced, fresh whole food isn\xe2\x80\x99t the cure for every disease that afflicts cats and dogs, it is the very best foundation upon which to build a protocol that can return a sick animal to good health. Simply put, when your pet\xe2\x80\x99s organs must work overtime to digest and absorb species-inappropriate nutrients from a processed diet, it inhibits the body\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to achieve and maintain a state of homeostasis.</i> (Becker, 1997\xe2\x80\x932020)</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Both canned foods and kibble undergo extreme processing to make them shelf stable.

Otherwise, you may be feeding your dog meat ingredients that can contain pathogen-laden diseased or medication-laden euthanized animals. Home-cooked meals can also be great for your dog! If you choose to home-cook, start with trustworthy recipes or prepare a healthy meal for yourself and cook a little extra for your dog: Take care to avoid human foods on the dog toxicity list. Find nutritionally balanced recipes using human-grade ingredients. Reliable sources such as BalanceIT<span style=" font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: super;">\xc2\xae</span> (2004\xe2\x80\x9320), founded by board certified veterinary nutritionist Sean Delaney, DVM, DACVN, who co-authored a leading textbook on veterinary clinical nutrition, formulates every recipe online for the specific needs of each pet.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Protein should come mainly from animal versus plant sources. Choose a protein-rich, not carbohydrate-rich diet. Canines have few dietary requirements for carbohydrates; however, some commercial dog foods may contain up to 90% grains because grains are inexpensive and increase calories. Grain-free processed kibble is also too often overloaded with calories and carbohydrates. Dr. Doug Knueven, DVM, holistic nutritional expert and sought-after veterinary conference speaker, suggests that you choose a food with a small percentage of healthy whole grains that provide complex carbohydrates. High-protein diets are generally linked to high performance, whereas high simple carbohydrate diets are linked to obesity in dogs (Knueven, 2008).</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 80%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image10.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Normal">There are some excellent dehydrated, air-dried, and freeze-dried foods as well. However, if you choose to feed kibble, try to feed a kibble that contains as many organic ingredients as possible. Purchase a 2-week supply of kibble and keep it refrigerated. Oxidation may degrade the essential nutrients that have been supplemented. Do not pour the food out of the bag into another container. Add water or a scoop of wet food to the kibble: Kibble does not provide enough water during a meal. Chewing kibble does <i>not</i> clean the teeth.</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image11.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Feeding Raw</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">There is a controversial and sometimes contentious debate about feeding a raw diet, however, the evidence against it is inconclusive. Some veterinary organizations, such as the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) and the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) have taken positions against feeding raw food for what they believe to be public safety issues. They say,</p>\n<p class="P_Block_Quote"><i>The AVMA discourages the feeding to cats and dogs of any animal source protein that has not first been subjected to a process to eliminate pathogens because of the risk of illness to cats and dogs as well as humans. Cooking or pasteurization through the application of heat until the protein reaches an internal temperature adequate to destroy pathogenic organisms has been the traditional method used to eliminate pathogens in animal source protein, although the AVMA recognizes source protein, although the AVMA recognizes that newer technologies and other methods such as irradiation are constantly being developed and implemented.</i> (AVMA, 2019, September 5, para. 1).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">If you choose to feed raw, ensure that your dog is eating a nutritionally balanced diet. If you are creating meal plans, include raw meat, organ meat, shredded fruits, vegetables, ground and raw meaty bones, and the appropriate supplements. Raw meaty bones are typically half meat with bone that is consumed, such as chicken necks, backs and legs; turkey necks; pork and lamb necks and breasts, and canned boney fish such as sardines, salmon, and mackerel. Canned fish is pre-cooked. Conveniently frozen raw meals of meat, bone, and vegetables are now widely available. Take precautions with food handling hygiene as you do with any raw meat to prevent possible bacterial or parasitic contamination of hands, surfaces, and utensils. Special precautions must be taken for immune-suppressed individuals who are particularly susceptible to pathogens.</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image12.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Normal">A popular public service resource for comparing both wet and dry brands is <a href="http://www.DogFoodAdvisor.com">DogFoodAdvisor.com</a>. The website\xe2\x80\x99s research team of professionals dedicated to canine wellness includes a veterinarian. Dog Food Advisor reviews hundreds of dog food brand products from A\xe2\x80\x93Z, interprets nutritional content, evaluates additives, and publishes recall notices. Their reputation for fairness has made them a leader in helping pet parents and business owners. Another source in the form of an annual review for pet parents is <i>The Whole Dog Journal</i>,<i> </i>which rates dry and wet food brands.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The <i>Whole Dog Journal</i> in \xe2\x80\x9cDiets, Dogs, and DCM\xe2\x80\x9d, Straus and Kerns (2019) analyzed data released by the FDA, in an attempt to determine if there is a link between reported cases of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and the affected dogs\xe2\x80\x99 diets. They report, \xe2\x80\x9cNo one knows for sure what might explain a link between certain types of diets and DCM in some dogs\xe2\x80\x9d (2019, October 22, para. 6). The article provides safety precautions, recommendations, and references to the updates, and reports of medical interest. Legumes, namely peas are currently suspected.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Obesity is the most common nutritional disorder in dogs. An excess of 15% over the ideal bodyweight is considered obese and is most often caused by either excessive caloric intake or inadequate exercise, or a combination of the two. Studies indicate that 18 to 44% of dogs are either overweight or obese. Risk factors for obesity include: Dietary practices, female gender, neutering, age, and breed, namely, Labrador Retrievers, Cairn Terriers, Cocker Spaniels, Dachshunds, Shetland Sheep Dogs, Basset Hounds, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, and Beagles. The socio-economic and dietary habits of the pet parent are factors in dog obesity as well (Collard et al., 2006). A scientific meta-analysis review of causes of obesity in dogs says that we should not use body weight alone to evaluate a dog\xe2\x80\x99s nutritional needs when planning meals. Your dog\xe2\x80\x99s lifestyle, neuter status, activity level, age, medical condition, and health history must be considered as well (Birmingham et al., 2014).</p>\n<p id="fresh_water" class="P_Subheader_-16">Fresh Water</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Although truly fresh water is often overlooked for pets, water unfit for you to drink is also most very likely harmful for your dog. Pet parents often mistakenly take the quality of the tap water they give their pets for granted. If you drink spring, distilled, filtered, or bottled water, consider providing quality water as a must for your pet, hand-in-glove with a nutritious diet.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Fresh water is vital for all known forms of life. Unless you are feeding a wet or raw diet, drinking water is most likely your dog\xe2\x80\x99s <i>only</i> source of hydration for metabolic processes. Water regulates temperature, carries nutrients and oxygen to all cells, lessens the burden on the kidneys and liver by flushing out urine and feces and other toxins, aids in digestion, and dissolves minerals and other nutrients so they are accessible to the body. Water also lubricates joints, moistens tissues such as those in the mouth, eyes, and nose, helps prevent constipation, and protects the body\xe2\x80\x99s organs and tissues (Mayo Clinic, 2020a).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">A National Resource Defense Council (2003) study cites an article, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s on Tap,\xe2\x80\x9d revealing that the tap water of scores of United States cities is compromised. Pollution, old pre-World War I pipes, and outdated treatment facilities and processing put dogs at risk from contaminants that breed bacteria and fail to remove toxins such as pesticides, industrial chemicals, and arsenic which can be found in tap water. Diarrhea is often linked to food choice, yet the role that contaminated water may play in diarrhea and cancer is often overlooked. In a recent meta-analysis (Ercumen et al., 2014), aging water distribution systems in the United States and other developed countries were found to allow pathogens that cause diarrhea. Most cities are not in violation of the national standards, yet the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards are weak. For example, the EPA allows 10pps of arsenic although scientists concur there is no safe level of arsenic in drinking water.</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent_SB"><b>Note:</b> Water should <i>not</i> be rationed for housetraining.

There is irrefutable evidence that regular physical activity is vital to help prevent several chronic diseases such as: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer hypertension, obesity, depression, osteoporosis, and premature death (Brendin et al., 2006). In <i>Decoding Your Dog: </i>\xe2\x80\x9cAll Dogs Need a Job,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Mary Klinck, DVM, tells us that a dog\xe2\x80\x99s need for exercise is dependent on life stage, breed, and personality; however, individuals within each breed can vary significantly (Klinck, 2014).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Exercise needs are unique to each dog. Have an integrative force-free veterinarian complete a wellness check for your dog before beginning an exercise regimen. Too much, too little, or the wrong type of exercise and mental stimulation can lead to medical and behavior problems (Marcellin-Little et al., 2005). Sadly, there has been very little research about the optimal frequency, intensity, and duration of exercise for dogs. However, if your dog is overweight, monitor your dog carefully, slowly increasing frequency, intensity, and duration of exercise because the heart rate in overweight dogs during exercise is higher (Kuruvillaa, 2003).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Provide frequent and regular physical and mental exercise appropriate for your dog\xe2\x80\x99s medical condition, age, and breed. Proper exercise not only keeps your dog fit, but it also decreases stress. It is up to us humans to provide sufficient exercise that is fun, while at the same time keeps our dogs safe. Remember our dogs play by their own rules and they simply cannot be trusted to make good decisions, by our standards, on any regular basis!</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Exercise, Mood and Behavior</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Scientists have studied the euphoria known as <i>runners high</i> that is experienced during and after long-distance running and strenuous exercise. Is it any wonder our dogs love to run? The <i>opioid theory</i> is believed to be involved in mood enhancement during and after exercise. The increase in the body\xe2\x80\x99s naturally produced opioid endorphins released during exercise has a positive effect on depression and anxiety as well (Boecker et al., 2008). In a recent study, a lack of sufficient daily exercise was associated with canine anxiety. Dogs who exercised less suffered more noise sensitivity and more separation anxiety distress. More exercise may provide a solution for anxious dogs (Tiira &amp; Lohi, 2015).</p>\n<p id="types_of_exercise_for_life_stages" class="P_Subheader_-_14">Types of Exercise for Life Stages</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Exercise for Puppies\xe2\x80\x94They Have Special Needs</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Puppies have special exercise needs. Frequent self-regulated free-play sessions are encouraged for puppies. Arranging casual play dates with dogs who \xe2\x80\x9cplay nice\xe2\x80\x9d are great for exercise and wonderful socialization for your puppy. Protect your puppy by preventing jumping and falling down. More than 50% of fractures occur in animals less than one year of age (Animal Medical Center of Southern California, 2016). Jumping off of beds, couches, and people\xe2\x80\x99s laps, are major causes of spinal and other bone fractures in puppies. Avoid running, long hikes, and long walks until your dog is between 10 and 18 months old, dependent upon size and breed. Here\xe2\x80\x99s why:</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The bone growth plates are soft cartilage areas that sit at the end of long bones (limbs and pelvis) in puppies and adolescent dogs who are still growing. Bone plates are a weak link, soft and vulnerable to injury. Sex hormone changes in puberty cause the growth plates to close and the plates then calcify and become a stable inflexible part of the bone. Puberty is a landmark for both growth plate closure and for slowly increasing exercise. In puppies the closure is, on average, completed by approximately 10 months of age in large dog breeds, a few months earlier in small dog breeds, and a few months later in giant dog breeds\xe2\x80\x94up to 18 months of age (Provet Healthcare Information, 2013; Marcellin-Little et al., 2005). Specific cautionary measures and additional breed-specific orthopedic concerns should be discussed with your trusted force-free veterinarian.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Exercise for Adult Dogs</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Providing daily runs or alternate opportunities to run and play is vital to your dog\xe2\x80\x99s physical health and emotional well-being. Most healthy dogs love to run! Make sure your dog is properly conditioned before participating in strenuous or athletic activities. Always prepare the muscles to reduce the risk of injury with a warm-up by starting with slow walking and then increasing intensity to jogging gradually over 5\xe2\x80\x9310 minutes. Be certain your dog is comfortable with the level of intensity before increasing duration, distance, or intensity. Consider enrolling your healthy adult dog in an aerobic dog sport class or joining a local group for swimming, agility training, fly-ball, dog dancing, hoops, lure-coursing, or terrain-intensive scent work.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Your dog, more than likely, will not be cautious about excessive exercise so it is up to you to monitor activities carefully. Excessive frequency, intensity, or duration of exercise can have a negative impact causing injury or making an existing condition even worse. Be sure to provide rest breaks, and build endurance slowly, to avoid cardiovascular fatigue. Fatigue can result in injuries. Be on the lookout for limping, excessive panting, or a reluctance to exercise. Exercise should be joyful. Involving other dogs makes physical activity even more stimulating.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Generally speaking, exercise gear may be a topic of heated discussion but not in the force-free training community. Force-free dog trainers recommend a back or front-clip harness for walking and running in order to distribute the pressure across the dog\xe2\x80\x99s chest and body, rather than around the neck and throat structures. If safe for you, your dog, and others, let your dog run naked just with a collar and identification tags.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The benefits gained from safely practiced aerobic and non-aerobic exercise are enriching for both you and your dog. Look for unique trails, parks, beach areas, and neighborhoods to explore. If you prefer to watch rather than run, arrange for a play date with another friendly dog, or visit a safe leash-free dog park<i> if</i> your dog is a well-mannered social butterfly. (See Chapter 9, Dog Parks and Dog Play.)</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Exercise for Aging or Senior Dogs</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">For the most part, just like humans, senior dogs continue their desire for activity and exercise, but at a slower pace. Arthritis may negatively impact your dog\xe2\x80\x99s ability, comfort, and desire to exercise. Understanding both the physical and the behavioral factors involved in our aging dogs provides the best exercise guidance.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Find ways to include your aging dog in your daily activities\xe2\x80\x94being left home alone often quickens the decline of your senior dog\xe2\x80\x99s mental and physical condition. Pay attention to your dog\xe2\x80\x99s comfort limit with distance and other endurance factors on walks. A dog stroller or wagon will allow your dog to continue to be part of family activities. Walk for a short distance and then let your aging dog enjoy a ride in the stroller or wagon even if you have a multi-dog household, keeping everyone together if possible. \xe2\x80\x9cSniffari\xe2\x80\x9d walks, mainly to sniff, are highly enjoyable for most aging dogs. Sniffing is the window to the world where they can experience novelty.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">For dogs who have always loved riding in the car, keep riding! If your dog is too large for you to lift into the car, make a small investment in stairs or a ramp. These aides may be the most practical way of including your dog on these visually enriching and olfactory stimulating adventures.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Scent tracking and interactive toys can be a wonderful source of mental enrichment when physical activity is limited. Therapeutic supervised swimming using a life jacket, socializing with appropriate playmates on the same activity level, or even playing with a respectful puppy whose playstyle is monitored, may help keep your aging dog stimulated.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">For more guidance about senior dog exercise, Dr. Karen Overall (2013, pp. 690\xe2\x80\x93697) has a brilliant section, i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cProtocol for Understanding and Helping Geriatric Animals\xe2\x80\x9d<i>,</i> in her <i>Manual of Clinical Behavioral Medicine.</i></p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">If You Cannot Exercise Your Dog</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">If you cannot exercise your dog, a training-savvy and trustworthy friend or vetted force-free dog walker can help. Do not let anyone else use a choke, slip, prong, or shock collar on your dog. These collars have been shown to cause injuries to dogs. Make it clear to your dog walker that your dog is to be walked on their harness. (See Chapter 16, Leash-walking.)</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">If your dog needs more exercise than you can provide or if you have limited space, when safe for your dog\xe2\x80\x99s age, medical condition, and morphological structure, consider exercising with a lure/chase toy. Some physically challenged pet parents who are unable to exercise their dog outside of the home find a lure-chase toy a convenient way to make sure their dog runs each day. This toy is also recommended for pet parents who do not have enough time to exercise their dog on any given day. The chase-lure toy is especially beneficial for prey-driven, high-activity level dogs or powerful breeds that love and need to run. It works great for small breeds as well and is a lot of fun for the handler.</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image14.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Lure-chase Toy Rules</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">There are some important caveats regarding lure-chase toys.</p>\n<ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">\n<li class="P_ListItem_1"><p class="P_ListParagraph_3">The lure should be kept near the ground, not lifted into the air.

Toss treats, one at a time up the stairs.<b> </b>Do not toss anything down the stairs as this could result in injuries to dogs tripping and falling down the stairs.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Digging is another great natural exercise for your dog that does not require daily time or physical effort from pet parents. Get a sand box or designate a special spot in the yard reserved for a <i>dog zone digging pit</i> where you regularly bury goodies.</p>\n<p id="sufficient_air" class="P_Subheader_-16">Sufficient Air</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">A puppy\xe2\x80\x99s first breath is a critical sign of life outside of the womb. Air is a metabolic requirement for survival, and it is the need that must be met first. Abraham Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s original work, <i>A Theory of Human Motivation</i> (1943, The Basic Needs section, para. 16.) delineates the basic physiological needs to maintain the body\xe2\x80\x99s homeostasis. One of the most basic of these needs is the need for oxygen. Oxygen travels through the lungs and is then transferred to red blood cells that carry the oxygen to all of the organs in the body that require oxygen to function.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">If your dog is having breathing problems, see your veterinarian as soon as possible. Breathing difficulties can quickly become life threatening. Air is a <i>deficiency need </i>(Maslow, 1943) and if dogs are unable to satisfy their need for air, at a minimum they are uncomfortable and at the extreme, they are suffering and often medically endangered. The body cannot function properly with inadequate oxygen and will ultimately fail.</p>\n<p id="airway_injuries_from_choke_and_prong_collars" class="P_Subheader_-_14">Airway Injuries from Choke and Prong Collars</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Dogs are not morphologically built for collars around the neck. Choke and prong collars <i>when used correctly</i>, choke. The use of choke and prong collars exacerbate breathing problems, particularly in our brachycephalic breeds, and may cause medical injury to the trachea, which is essential to breathing.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Choking collars are typically made of metal, chain, or rope euphemistically called a <i>slip lead</i>. Rope is the device of choice used for hanging, therein, the purpose of the slip lead and a noose are much the same i.e., to choke. The metal spikes on prong collars are, additionally, often sharpened to inflict more pain and pressure, resulting in injury. The use of choke and prong collars exerting enormous pressure in pounds per square inch on the spikes, exacerbate breathing problems\xe2\x80\x94particularly in brachycephalic breeds, and may cause medical injury to the trachea, which is essential to breathing. According to Eileen Anderson, in \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Prong Collars Hurt\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cThe pressure on the prong collar is concentrated into multiple small areas (like spike heels) instead of being dispersed with blunted prongs of a medium size (you can obtain prongs that are smaller and sharper), the pressure is approximately 155 times that caused by a flat collar\xe2\x80\x9d (Anderson, 2017, para. 32).</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image16.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Block_Quote_NSA"><b>Dr. Sophia Yin, DVM, on Choke Chains</b></p>\n<p class="P_Block_Quote_NSA"><i>So why do I avoid the choke chain</i> . . . <i>there are many medical and safety reasons. Not surprisingly, strong yanking on the neck with a chain can cause health issues. If the force from a dog pulling on a flat collar raises intraocular pressure [pressure inside the eyes], imagine how high that pressure must rise when you actually yank the dog with a thin chain! Even if your dog has no eye issues, the choke chain is notorious at exacerbating airway issues. For instance, it can worsen coughing in dogs prone to collapsing trachea (weak trachea that flatten more than they should) and affect the ability of dogs with small tracheas, such as pugs and bulldogs, to breathe. </i>(Yin, 2012a, Choke Chain section, para. 5).</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image17.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Normal">This report from a senior veterinary clinician appears in the <i>New York Post</i>, \xe2\x80\x9cPet owners might use choke or prong collars to help train a dog that pulls on the leash, but accidents with these devices can cause serious injury, including permanent neurological problems\xe2\x80\x94or even death,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. David Bessler, senior emergency clinician at Blue Pearl Veterinary Partners in Manhattan. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole point of a choke collar is that it applies force 360 degrees,\xe2\x80\x9d he explains. If a dog surprises an owner and takes off running, the collar snaps the pet back, causing whiplash, or choking. Bessler recalls a fatal case where an owner stepped on a leash as the dog started to run: \xe2\x80\x9cIt caused an upper-airway obstruction and that dog drowned in its own fluid\xe2\x80\x9d (Bessler (n.d.) cited in Sala, (2014). Punitive training with a choke collar, such as strangulation by holding a dog off the ground by a choke collar (a not uncommon practice), can cause severe brain damage (Dickomeit et al., 2013).</p>\n<p id="brachycephalic_obstructive_airway_syndrome__boas_" class="P_Subheader_-_14">Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome (BOAS)</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Short noses and wide set eyes might make dogs look cute and childlike, but these features are often associated with breathing difficulty and may come at a very high price to our dogs: Make no mistake, BOAS is a painful condition in dogs. The risk increases as the morphology becomes more and more exaggerated.</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image18.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Breeder and Veterinarian Responsibility and BOAS</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Brachycephalic airway syndrome (BOAS) may affect puppies as young as three months of age (Meola, 2013). Veterinarians and kennel clubs must discuss the problem openly with colleagues and pet parents. Due to the serious medical and welfare implications and the increasing popularity of the brachycephalic breeds, efforts to separate fashion from health are needed. Risk factors should be used to guide breeding decisions. In a study on the impact of facial conformity on canine heath, Packer et al., (2015) warns, \xe2\x80\x9cAs such, breeders and buyers should be aware of these risks when selecting a dog and breeding organizations should actively discourage exaggerations of this high-risk conformation in breed standards and the show ring.\xe2\x80\x9d A fundamental rethink in brachycephalic breeding is necessary to save the breeds.</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image19.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Normal">Breathing disorders increase as muzzle length shortens. Breed-related air obstruction disorders are commonly associated with some of the extreme conformation standards established by breed and kennel clubs. Breeds such as the Pug, English Bulldog, Boston Terrier, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, French Bulldog, Boxer, Pekingese, Shih Tzu, Japanese Chin, Shar-Pei, Lhasa Apso, and short-nosed crossbreeds are at great risk of developing BOAS because the soft tissue is crammed within the skull (Burn et al., 2012) often resulting in chronic and debilitating respiratory dysfunction. Thicker necks and obesity are additional exacerbating factors in brachycephalic dogs (Burn et al., 2015).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Pet parents too often dismiss labored chronic breathing difficulties and respiratory noise as normal despite their dogs\xe2\x80\x99 obvious difficulty breathing, overheating, gagging, and choking while on short walks. Dogs may physically collapse and die due to lack of oxygen. Although these pet dogs often show severe clinical signs of BOAS, many pet parents do not recognize that their dog has a breathing problem. Pet parents may believe that these breathing abnormalities are normal signs of aging. Too often these dogs have acute attacks or lose consciousness before a pet parent recognizes breathing is a problem and seek medical help. In a recent study (Liu et al., 2015), 60% of French Bulldog pet parents failed to recognize BOAS in their dogs. Indeed, research finds that 58% of surveyed pet parents of brachycephalic breeds may be suffering because pet parents believe that breathing difficulties, noisy and labored breathing, gagging and choking are \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d for that breed (Burn et al., 2012b). Some pet parents describe the medical symptoms of respiratory dysfunction as \xe2\x80\x9ccute.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">According to Dr. Gerhard Oechtering (2010), faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Leipzig, Germany, \xe2\x80\x9cMalformations and collapsibility of the upper airways are much more complex than previously thought.\xe2\x80\x9d A dog\xe2\x80\x99s nose is thought to be essential for effective thermoregulation. Stenotic nares are pinched or narrow nostrils that make it difficult to breathe and cause snorting and snoring. Laryngeal collapse may occur as a result of stenotic nares and tracheal narrowing and lead to death.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Jemima Harrison, producer of the 2008 BBC Documentary, <i>Pedigree Dogs Exposed</i>, highlights the serious nature of some of the health and welfare problems in purebred dogs. Harrison sheds light on the reality of the suffering of many brachycephalic breeds. She reports, \xe2\x80\x9cMany flat-faced dogs try to sleep sitting or even standing up because their airways block when they drop their heads. It means that some brachycephalic dogs are chronically sleep-deprived\xe2\x80\x9d (Harrison, 2016, para. 1). The Royal Veterinary College at the University of London (O\xe2\x80\x99Neil et al., 2015), reports, \xe2\x80\x9cThese dogs may not be able to enjoy the simple pleasures in a dog\xe2\x80\x99s life such as exercise, play, food and sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Polluted Air</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Do your best to protect your dog from both indoor and outdoor air pollution when reasonably plausible, just as you would for yourself. Exposure to air pollution has been shown to produce cognitive deficits and brain lesions in dogs as shown by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study published in the <i>Journal of Brain and Cognition</i>. The study examined the effect of pollution on brain abnormalities in dogs and children (Barragan-Mejia et al., 2008). Use air purifiers in your home. Avoid smoke-filled rooms and walking your dog when the <i>Air Quality Index</i> (n.d.) is high for humans.</p>\n<p id="sufficient_sleep" class="P_Subheader_-16">Sufficient Sleep</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Sufficient sleep is a fundamental biological need for our dogs. Sleep, along with food, water, and oxygen is essential to survival. Sleep is a critical requirement for optimal health and emotional well-being. Puppies and dogs need to get the quality sleep and the rest their bodies crave. Your dog\xe2\x80\x99s species-specific need for sleep is both similar and different from what humans need. Although sufficient sleep is not discussed frequently, veterinarians, breeders, pet parents, trainers, shelter workers and foster parents are responsible for seeing that the dogs in their care have adequate sleep opportunities. Sleep needs vary with age, health, lifestyle, and among individuals. Sleep strengthens the immune, skeletal, and muscular systems. Dogs suffer physically and psychologically and cannot thrive without sufficient sleep.</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 80%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image20.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Normal">Newborn humans require on average twice as much sleep as adults. Similarly, puppies need <i>lots</i> of extra sleep to grow, heal wounds and store energy to develop and function properly. Many rescue dogs come from very stressful environments, sometimes unavoidably so, with little opportunity for true relaxation. They may be at critical risk for exhaustion and thus, have special sleep needs. To read more about sufficient sleep, see Diane Garrod\xe2\x80\x99s book, <i>Stress Release For Dogs: The Canine Emotional Detox </i>(Garrod, 2021).</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Sleep Deprivation</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Sleep deprivation has been found to increase aggressiveness and decrease effective social interactions (Kahn et al., 2006). Sleep deprivation is associated with a compromised immune system, diabetes, weight gain, obesity, depression, hormonal imbalances, and can more than double the risk of cardiovascular disease (Brown et al., 2012). According to Bentivogliio &amp; Grassi-Zucconi (1997, pp. 570\xe2\x80\x93576), \xe2\x80\x9cPioneering canine experimental studies going as far back as 1894 show that sleep is a vital function, and that the lack of sleep causes brain damage and eventually death. The complete absence of sleep was found to be fatal for puppies in a few days. Adult dogs died after 9\xe2\x80\x9317 days without sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Sleep deprivation shortens attention span, increases anxiety, impairs memory, and has a negative effect on mood. The relationship between sleep deprivation and anxiety is well documented in clinical research (Pires &amp; Anderson, 2012). Anxiety is one of the most insidious emotional consequences of both dream sleep (REM) deprivation and deep-sleep deprivation. Generalized anxiety disorder and phobias are associated with sleep deprivation, so anxiety may also cause sleep deprivation.</p>\n<p id="dog_vs__human_sleep_patterns" class="P_Subheader_-_14">Dog vs. Human Sleep Patterns</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">There may be a genetically hard-wired reason for your dog\xe2\x80\x99s rumbling about during the night. Periodically scanning the environment may be an innate, residually adaptive behavior, which served to detect predators and protect survival in the wild.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The 24-hour internal clock drives all animals. Circadian rhythms are biologically built-in, even in nocturnal animals (Edgar et al., 2012). One study on dog sleeping habits shows that your dog\xe2\x80\x99s rest occurs mostly at night, but their activity increases approximately 2 hours before dawn, and they become most active at dawn, on average. Dogs often nap around the noon hour and have slower activity during the afternoon hours (Tobler &amp; Sigg, 1985). Approximately 44% of your dog\xe2\x80\x99s time is spent in alert wakefulness and 21% in the drowsy state. Adult dogs sleep approximately one-third to one-half of a 24-hour-cycle, with an average internal bedtime of 9 pm and rising time of 4 am, according to a classic dog sleep study (Lucas, et al., 1977). Dr. Alexandra Horowitz (2009) also suggests dogs may have a burst of energy in the evening because of their species-specific sleep-wake patterns.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">As stated above, sleep-wake <i>patterns</i> are species-specific. Humans most commonly sleep for several hours in a single session whereas dogs do not. A 1993 study of sleep-wake activity in dogs showed that the typical pattern of sleeping and waking in dogs is very different than that in people, contrary to popular belief (Adams &amp; Johnson, 1993). Within an 8-hour period, the 24 dogs in the study had 23 sleep-wake cycles on average, of 21 minutes each: they would sleep for 16 minutes and then spontaneously awaken for 5 minutes! Unlike humans, these dogs appeared to become fully conscious during those 5 minutes of wakefulness. When two or more dogs slept together, they each had their own sleep-wake cycling, unaffected by the other dogs cycling. Think of your dog needing power naps throughout the day. Power naps promote performance and learning, help to restore balance to immune and neuroendocrine systems, and are ideal for the genetically hard-wired canine sleep-wake cycle.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Carefully choose the placement of your dog\xe2\x80\x99s bed. Wolves have dens, humans have bedrooms, and so your dog ought to have some sanctuary as well. For daytime power naps, your dog may prefer an open-door crate in a corner of a bedroom or other room, a cloth covered open crate, or an orthopedic bed set apart from the line of traffic in your home. Puppies require more sleep than adult dogs. Keeping puppies in the center of the living room, with human activity continually disturbing their sleep, fosters stress. When setting up containment areas for newborn puppies, responsible breeders should keep each puppy\xe2\x80\x99s sleep needs in mind, balancing <i>Biological Needs</i> with <i>Social Needs</i>. Senior dogs often require more sanctuary space as a safety net apart from other animals in the home to protect their aging bodies and allow for additional sleep needs.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">People pay close attention to the type of spinal and back support our own mattresses provide and understand how important proper sleep support is for our own well-being, however, pet parents often make the mistake of choosing the cutest or cushiest beds for their dogs. All dogs, particularly dogs with long spinal columns such as Dachshunds and giant breeds, need a bed with sufficient spinal support. Why not give your dog the best of both worlds\xe2\x80\x94orthopedic support and cute blankets and pillows if you wish. If the only soft bed for your dog does not allow your dog to stretch fully, a remodel of the <i>dog zone </i>is in order to provide a truly optimal sleep environment for your best friend.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Separate, but close sleeping quarters may help both canines and humans sleep better at night. As a social and domesticated species, emotionally healthy dogs generally want and need to be in close proximity to us. However, just as humans need a quiet environment for restful rejuvenation, so do our dogs. Consider a change in sleeping locations or quarters if your need for sleep is out of sync with your dog\xe2\x80\x99s sleep-wake cycles. When choosing restful sleeping quarters, the National Sleep Foundation (2016) reminds us to factor in proper temperature control, sound, and light.</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image21.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Dog Dreaming and Deep Sleep</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Approximately 23% of your dog\xe2\x80\x99s time is spent in deep-sleep, and 12% in the dream state associated with rapid eye movement (REM) (Lucas et al., 1977). During REM sleep, your dog\xe2\x80\x99s eyes may roll, they may whimper, shake, whine, growl, and even bark on occasion. They often appear to be chasing something with all four legs pumping the air! Fascinatingly, because a large portion of your dog\xe2\x80\x99s brain is devoted to processing scent, your dog may be dreaming in the scent sensory mode as well! \xe2\x80\x9cThose who see smells must remember in smells, too: When we imagine dog\xe2\x80\x99s dreaming and daydreaming, we should envisage dream images made of scents,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Horowitz reports in <i>Inside of a Dog</i> (2009, p. 88).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Puppies spend a greater percentage of time in the dream state than adult dogs, very likely processing all of the new information they are absorbing each day. Dreaming may be a bridge between the brain and behavior, having useful functions similar to dream function for humans.</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image22.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Normal">Dogs adopt many different sleeping positions, some by choice, some as a security measure\xe2\x80\x94and some because the only bed provided is in the shape of a donut. Feral dogs and wolves curl up into a ball with their paws tucked under their body and tails wrapped over the face to conserve body heat and protect their limbs, face, throat, and vital organs. This is the least vulnerable and<i> </i>least restful position for sleeping, however this position allows for a quick leap to the feet for fight or flight. Some dogs sleep on their stomach, also allowing them to jump to their feet easily in the event of a threat or an interesting activity they would like to follow. We also see the \xe2\x80\x9csplotz<i>\xe2\x80\x9d</i> tummy position (rear legs outstretched) that is often more restful, but still ready to leap into action. Dogs that sleep outstretched on their side are genuinely able to relax and are most often feeling secure in their surroundings. Some dogs sleep belly-up with their legs in the air.

Heatstroke may result from something as unexpected as fence-fighting with a visiting dog in the next yard, or from playing chase through the fence with your neighbor mowing the lawn. Sunburn is painful and can lead to skin cancer. Protect pink noses, bellies, inside of the ears and top of the head, with a non-toxic sunscreen on short-haired/thin-skinned dogs when your dog is outdoors.

There is no empirical data to support the efficacy of this training or that demonstrates that snake-aversion training by shock does all, or any part of, what it promises to do. Additionally, shock training may give pet parents a dangerously false sense of security. Many snakebites occur by inadvertently disturbing a snake and no amount of shock training will prevent that.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Behavior experts tell us that shock is easily misapplied and can traumatize animals, and result in severe and permanent side effects, such as the fear of the great outdoors, or men, for example. The reaction that snake aversion training promises to teach is flight. However, science tells us that the various responses to fear, pain, and shock include fight, flight, freeze, fawn, and others. The <i>Fight-flight Syndrome</i> is scientifically unpredictable according to Nijenhuis et al., in the <i>Journal of Traumatic Stress</i> (1998).

No competent dog trainer uses shock for any purpose. Learning should never hurt. Alternative, non-aversive, snake avoidance training methods are springing up because of the need to find an alternate, more effective, and safer method than shock. Popular and effective new courses in real life scenarios of an outdoor hike, teach your dog to alert you immediately upon encountering a snake, similar to basic service dog training.

The safest, least stressful, and most effective way to teach a dog to swim is to use a properly-fitted life jacket. A life jacket often helps new swimmers relax enough to paddle with all four legs. Desensitize your dog to wearing a dog life jacket to keep him afloat and to provide peace of mind for you. Your dog\xe2\x80\x99s innate ability to swim or ease in learning to swim is, in part, determined by breed and body morphology. Even some retrievers need a helping hand to learn and find the confidence to swim for fun and exercise. Breeds with short legs and wide chests such as Bulldogs, Boston Terriers, Corgis, and Pugs, simply were not bred for swimming. Large, muscled breeds such as the <i>bully</i> breeds, require a great deal of energy expenditure in the water due to their significant body mass.

One of the most important things you must teach your dog is how and where to exit the pool, should your dog accidentally fall in or literally get lost while swimming. Do not allow your dog to drink excessive amounts of chlorinated water from the pool and always make fresh water readily available. Rinse your dog off thoroughly after swims in the pool and out in nature. Dry your dog\xe2\x80\x99s ears and dry under the collar. Learn CPR for pets.

Hyperthermia, more commonly known as heatstroke, is an environmental or exertion caused life-threatening medical emergency in dogs. Dogs regulate their temperature and cool themselves by evaporation (panting) and conduction (transfer of heat to a cool surface). Panting creates a cooling effect through evaporation of saliva in the mouth, on the tongue and from the lining of the lungs. The primary cooling mechanism for dogs is panting with the mouth open (Coren, 2010).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Unlike humans, sweating is not a significant mechanism of cooling for a dog. Dogs have no other efficient way of getting rid of body heat other than panting. Dogs do not have sweat glands, except in their feet. Your dog\xe2\x80\x99s fur coat can easily make your dog susceptible to overheating. Fur is an insulator that keeps the heat (and cold) out, as long as your dog is not in a continuously hot environment. Once the body temperature rises, however, fur slows the cooling process because heat from the body cannot escape. Dogs not properly conditioned to exercise in the heat and humidity, and older dogs may suffer heatstroke very quickly.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Dogs left outdoors or locked in cars may suffer hyperthermia where the dog\xe2\x80\x99s body temperature becomes elevated because it is producing or absorbing more heat than it can release.

Dogs who are panting heavily and if the environment permits, seeking shade, cool surfaces, and drinking water to bring body temperature down are experiencing heat stress. A staggering gait and the appearance of \xe2\x80\x9cdrunkenness\xe2\x80\x9d means your dog may be falling victim to heatstroke. According to Flournoy et al., (2003), \xe2\x80\x9cSigns of heatstroke are: increased panting, drooling, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, rapid heart rate, and dry, sticky, and discolored (bright pink, reddish or purple) gums and tongue. Cortical blindness, cardiovascular collapse, unconsciousness, seizures, coma, central nervous system dysfunction, shallow breathing, and death may follow if veterinary care is not sought immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Know your dog\xe2\x80\x99s normal gum and tongue color so you will recognize changes in gum color should you suspect hyperthermia. If your dog is panting heavily and the gums are a dark pink\xe2\x80\x94stop, rest, come indoors and offer cool water immediately.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Treatment</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Treatment should be rapid and aggressive. Measures should be taken immediately and during transport to the veterinarian to lower the body temperature by spraying your dog with cool (<i>not cold)</i> water and allowing evaporation, opening windows, and using air-conditioning to dissipate the heat. Cool, wet towels along the back of the neck, groin, and armpits (sites of major blood vessels) with airflow can begin the cooling process while on the road to your veterinarian.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Cool the body gradually\xe2\x80\x94do NOT immerse your dog in cold water, administer cold-water enemas, or cover your dog\xe2\x80\x99s body with a wet towel: this can inhibit your dog\xe2\x80\x99s cooling mechanisms (Flournoy et al., 2003). Cold water immersion makes the core temperature rise, rather than decrease. Cold water also causes shivering generating heat and making it counterproductive to cooling.</p>\n<p id="hypothermia" class="P_Subheader_-_14">Hypothermia</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Hypothermia is a medical emergency that occurs when the body is losing heat faster than it can produce heat, causing a critically low body temperature. Hypothermia, in healthy dogs, is caused by either exposure to cold weather, wet fur and skin, or immersion in cold water (Mayo Clinic, 2020b, PetMD, 2010). Dogs at risk for hypothermia include puppies, seniors, those with low body fat, heart disease, kidney disease, and hypothyroidism.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Prevention</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Short-haired, thin-skinned, and toy breed dogs may lose heat particularly fast. If your dog is sensitive to cold, do not hesitate to add a sweater, or hoodie for sensitive ears, to provide extra warmth indoors and out. Add boots to protect tender pads when pads may suffer chemical burns from deicing salt or literally stick to icy pavement. Generally, avoid harsh weather, ice, and snow.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Symptoms</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Shivering is probably the first thing you would notice as your dog\xe2\x80\x99s body temperature drops. Shivering is the body\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to warm itself. If you notice your dog shivering on any occasion, barring a medical condition or fear, take action. However, be aware that <i>shivering stops</i> as hypothermia worsens. Lethargy often follows shivering and paleness (Miller, 2019). When your dog\xe2\x80\x99s body temperature drops, the heart, nervous system, and other organs are unable to function properly. Hypothermia can lead to coma, heart, and respiratory failure and ultimately to death.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Treatment</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The standard of care for hypothermia is to use warmed blankets from the clothes dryer, or a warm (<i>not hot</i>) hair dryer plus a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel against your dog\xe2\x80\x99s abdomen: an unwrapped water bottle may burn your dog\xe2\x80\x99s skin. Check your dog\xe2\x80\x99s temperature every 10 minutes. If the rectal temperature is below 98\xc2\xb0F, seek immediate veterinary care. The successful outcome of treating hypothermia warms the body back to a normal temperature.</p>\n<p id="gentle_grooming" class="P_Subheader_-16">Gentle Grooming</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Force-free training and force-free husbandry care go hand in glove.

Proper hygiene of your dog\xe2\x80\x99s coat is important for your dog\xe2\x80\x99s health, including the removal of excess hair fur nests or mats that may serve as havens for bacteria, parasites, and fleas. Seasoned, knowledgeable groomers can identify possible medical issues during grooming procedures that might otherwise go unnoticed such as: Abscesses, skin conditions, ear infections, tumors, cysts, insect bites, wounds, foxtails, pebbles, splinters, small bits of broken glass, worm infestations such as maggots, and areas of sensitivities where your dog has been biting or scratching. Head shaking may mean an ear infection.

Overgrown nails that reach and touch the floor can cause serious functional problems and deformities in your dog. Many dogs are either kept indoors or only run outdoors on soft grassy surfaces, so nails are not gradually worn down by running on concrete or blacktop. Regular nail clipping is necessary so that overgrown nails do not impede your dog\xe2\x80\x99s walking gait or cause skeletal deformities of the limbs and spine, which are often accompanied by pain (College of Veterinary Medicine, Washington State University, n.d.). Dewclaws on the inner side of the paw do not reach the ground so they are not worn down naturally as the dog walks, runs, and plays.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Health Problems and Pain Created by Overgrown Nails</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Overgrown nails lead to a vicious repetitive cycle of pain and avoidance. Dogs avoid having the nails and paws touched because of pain and fear, which leads to painful and unpleasant nail-trimming sessions, which leads to both the dog and pet parent avoiding nail trims, which leads to longer and longer intervals between nail trims, which in the end just leads to more pain.

There is a pressing need for the grooming industry to embrace more dog-friendly ethics and practices, making animal welfare the priority\xe2\x80\x94and for pet parents to accept less than perfect grooms. Dangerous grooming practices and negligence can cause injury and even death. Some of the most egregious examples include:</p>\n<ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">\n<li class="P_ListItem_1"><p class="P_ListParagraph_3"><b>Raising the grooming arm.</b> If your dog struggles while being groomed, it is not uncommon for some groomers to raise the grooming arm again and again until the dog stops struggling.

Seven hundred and ninety-one veterinarians participated in a campaign examining 17,938 pets. According to answers on the questionnaire, 7% of the dogs had never previously received a veterinary visit, 27% had not been seen in the past year, but 66% had been seen in the past year. A large percentage of dogs receiving veterinary care received little preventative care. The most common finding was overweight and obese dogs. The prevalence of disorders reported included obesity (33.5%), dental calculus (31.1%), inflammation of the external ear caused by bacteria (14%), mammary tumors (11.2%), cataract (9.5%), heart disease (6.4%), osteoarthritis (5.4%), and lameness (5.4%).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal"><b>Basic and specialty veterinary services.</b> Some of the basic and specialty advance care services veterinary professionals offer include: Wellness exams throughout the developmental stages, geriatric health care, vaccinations, urinalysis, microchipping, neutering and spaying, blood panels, treatments for infections and parasites including fleas and worms, dietary prescriptions for dogs who are ill, diagnostic x-rays, digital x-rays, cardiology, EKG/EEG, echocardiography, non-invasive ultrasound (sonogram) to evaluate the condition of internal organs, laser surgery, stem cell therapy, chemotherapy, orthopedic surgery for broken bones, patella abnormalities, joints, muscles, ligament injury, arthritis, tendons, and OFA-X-Ray to detect hip dysplasia, dermatology and rehabilitation for disease and injury.

Worldwide it is exceptional that veterinary specialists in behavior are faculty in veterinary medical schools and yet the biggest single killer of pet dogs (and cats) are behavior problems.\xe2\x80\x9d More dogs are relinquished by pet parents and euthanized by animal shelters for behavior problems than as a result of medical problems. Sadly, the average pet parent does not know that most veterinarians, being medical doctors, are not necessarily knowledgeable about dog behavior. This may become a serious problem if a pet parent seeks behavior advice from a veterinarian not academically schooled in behavior as they often provide opinions on behavior or recommend aversive trainers. Behavior management guidelines set forth by the <i>American Animal Hospital Association</i> (2020) are reviewed below.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The leading edge \xe2\x80\x9cPosition Statement on Humane Dog Training\xe2\x80\x9d from the American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior (AVSAB) (2021a) gives clear guidance as to the trainers and behavioral consultants veterinarians should and should not refer their clients to for training.

If a veterinarian refers patients to a dominance method dog trainer, or one who employs shock, prong, or choke collars, consider it a red flag pointing to the veterinarian\xe2\x80\x99s lack of sufficient and accurate knowledge about appropriate emotional and behavioral modification methods for pet dogs. If your veterinary clinic has not graduated to a dog-friendly approach, it is time to open the dialogue or find a pet centered veterinarian for your dog.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Renowned veterinarian, Dr. Marty Becker, developed the groundbreaking <i>Fear Free</i><span style=" font-style: italic; font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: super;">\xc2\xae</span> initiative and professional certification program (2020b) program. Becker is the chief veterinary correspondent for the American Humane Association and has written 22 books. Dr. Becker tells us, \xe2\x80\x9cOnce pets know fear, anxiety and stress, you cannot undo it. You can see it. You can smell it because dogs are stained with their own saliva from licking themselves. You can hear it and feel it\xe2\x80\x9d (Becker, (n.d.), cited in Manning 2016).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The <i>Fear Free</i> program uses a careful approach, gentle control techniques, and a calming veterinary clinic environment for your dog. The removal of anxiety triggers makes veterinary visits more enjoyable, safer, and less stressful for your dog, providing a setting conducive to the delivery of better veterinary care. The <i>Fear Free Level 1 Certification</i> (2020a) requires approximately 12 hours of online instruction. The program is designed for all individuals employed at a veterinary practice, including veterinarians, nurse technicians, groomers, customer service representatives and practice managers.</p>\n<p id="integrative_veterinary_care" class="P_Subheader_-_14">Integrative Veterinary Care</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Integrative veterinary medicine is a comprehensive approach to veterinary care that combines the best of <i>conventional allopathic medicine</i> (CAM) with alternative, natural, and holistic preventative, diagnostic, and therapeutic practices. Integrative veterinary practice promotes the benefits of natural medicine in support of conventional, allopathic, medicine. The integrative veterinary field is interested in researching new techniques, new products, and new treatments to help veterinarians provide the best possible care to animals.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The internationally renowned author, veterinarian, and force-free training advocate, Dr. Karen Becker, is a proactive and integrative wellness veterinarian. She describes her practice in this way, \xe2\x80\x9cMy goal is to help you create wellness in order to prevent illness in the lives of your pets. This proactive approach seeks to save you and your pet from unnecessary stress and suffering by identifying and removing health obstacles even before disease occurs\xe2\x80\x9d (Becker, 2019).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Veterinary Institute of Integrative Medicine (VIIM) was formed to help educate veterinarians and pet parents of the benefits of alternative approaches to healing animals and to bring integrative medicine to the forefront of animal healing. Integrative medicine seeks to treat the whole dog with an interest not limited to the medical history, but also genetics, nutrition, environment, family relationships, and stress levels. Integrative medicine asks the question, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x9d? The goal is to treat the underlying disease patterns, seeking to nurture all aspects of an animal\xe2\x80\x99s well-being, resulting in lasting physical, mental, and emotional health.</p>\n<p class="P_Block_Quote"><i>There is a dramatic paradigm shift occurring in the animal health care world.

Yet studies in brain anatomy and function demonstrate that changing behavior changes brain chemistry both during early development and in the adult brain (Kolb et al., 2003). Many integrative veterinarians suggest that more natural remedies and a solid management and emotional and behavioral modification program must be carefully explored and implemented before turning to medications. Psychiatric medications may be helpful in severe cases as well as cases that have not responded to emotional and behavioral modification, however, unlike humans, dogs cannot self-report on the effects they are experiencing from psychoactive drugs. All drugs have side effects and sometimes unexpected and opposite <i>paradoxical</i> effects as well. If medication is being considered, consulting with a veterinary behaviorist is highly recommended.</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image32.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p id="dental_care" class="P_Subheader_-_14">Dental Care</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 60%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image33.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The importance of regular professional dental care is often overlooked by pet parents and others involved with the care and training of your dog. It was not until the 1980s that there was a surge of interest in veterinary dentistry. According to the American Veterinary Dental Society, more than 80% of dogs develop gum disease by three years of age (Verstraete, 2016). Oral health is as necessary for your dog as it is for you and your other family members. Oral health has a profound effect on your dog\xe2\x80\x99s general health, so do not forget to clean and care for those beautiful pearly whites. If left untreated, dental disease is often very painful and can contribute to other oral cavity or systemic diseases (Bellows et al., 2019, 2005). Periodontal disease allows bacteria and toxins to enter the bloodstream with potentially harmful effects to internal organs. Diseases associated with periodontal disease in dogs include bronchitis, hepatitis, endocarditis, kidney disease, and pulmonary fibrosis due to chronic, recurrent low-grade infections (DeBowes et al., 1996).</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image34.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Signs of Oral and Dental Disease</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The American Veterinary Dental College (AVDC) provides a list of signs of oral and dental disease in dogs.

Annual dental check-ups and x-rays with a dental veterinarian are strongly recommended. Removal of dental plaque and tartar is critical to prevent dental disease both in dogs and humans. Disease-causing plaque mineralizes on teeth in two to three days and then cannot be removed by simple brushing. Regular professional dental cleaning is the most effective way to clean beneath the gum line to prevent periodontal disease and identify problems: anesthesia-free dental cleanings do not clean beneath the gum line.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Introduce daily or twice daily brushing slowly by rubbing your dog\xe2\x80\x99s teeth and gums with soft gauze wrapped around a finger. Gradually switch to a toothbrush designed for pets or to a very soft human toothbrush. Be patient, especially with older animals. Make brushing a bonding experience and avoid forceful restraint. Meat-flavored toothpaste can help! Fortunately, cavities occur much less frequently in dogs than in people (Hale, 1998).</p>\n<p id="in_memory_of_dr__sophia_yin__dvm__ms" class="P_Subheader_-16">In Memory of Dr. Sophia Yin, DVM, MS</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Dr. Sophia Yin, an internationally acclaimed veterinarian and applied animal behaviorist was at the forefront of the humane approach to handling pets in veterinary clinics, zoos, shelters, and in grooming with the goal of reducing fear and anxiety. Dr. Karen Overall, a close colleague of Yin\xe2\x80\x99s, tells us, \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no training program for what Sophia did. She chose to focus on the weakest link\xe2\x80\x94animals who are fearful in veterinary settings\xe2\x80\x9d (Overall in Zimlich, 2014, section, A Behavior Pioneer, para. 5).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Dr. Yin was a pioneer in her focus and concern about the emotional well-being of pets. Yin combined science with practical and functional applications while developing low-stress handling techniques for treating and working with animals. She shared her research and methods with professionals and with the public in academic journals, magazines, teaching seminars, workshops, books, and instructional materials, including <i>Low Stress Handling, Restraint and Behavior Modification for Dogs &amp; Cats: The Small Animal Veterinary Nerdbook</i>, her best-selling textbook, for veterinary hospitals and individual veterinarian certification (Yin, 2009). Her DVDs include <i>Low Stress Handling of Dogs and Cats: Creating a Pet-Friendly Hospital, Animal Shelter or Petcare Business </i>(Yin, 2012b).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Dr. Yin recognized early in her private practice that more dogs are euthanized due to behavior problems than medical issues. Her contributions improved the quality of life for our pets and increased the safety and efficiency of veterinary staff and other pet professionals, while paving the way for future developments in force-free training and animal care. Those involved in force-free emotional and behavioral modification feel deeply that her passing is a great loss to our field.</p>\n<div id="hoopla-highlight-container"></div></body>\n</html>'</p>

Each section can also serve as a standalone topic for a presentation tailored to the interest of a sub-population of dog lovers. For example, one topic of interest is the need for proper temperature control and how to avoid hyperthermia in the summer, and hypothermia in winter. Or a speaker for a breed rescue group might create a presentation on brachycephalic airway obstruction from the section of the handbook devoted to the need for air.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Examples for Pet Bloggers and Television Interviews</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The topics in this<i> </i>handbook and The Hierarchy of Dog Needs make excellent blog material. Force-free advocates can easily use the HDN to explain dog needs and force-free training during television spot presentations.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Examples for Classes</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent"><i>Do No Harm</i> <i>Management and Best Force-free Practices</i> methods illustrated by The Hierarchy of Dog Needs are a great segue laying a foundation for force-free training.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Consider developing a lesson guide of basic skills using the <i>Do No Harm Dog Training Handbook </i>as a foundation, using The Hierarchy of Dog Needs infographic as a handout for discussion during class. Use the training techniques and trainer \xe2\x80\x9csecrets<i>,\xe2\x80\x9d</i> such as capturing, luring, shaping, linking, and real-life reinforcement to teach force-free best practices in the context of teaching name response, sit, down, wait/stay, come, and leash-walking. Trainers who teach classes may rearrange the topic material and teach a basic skill in each class. Referencing the HDN throughout lessons with clients helps to emphasize the importance of meeting needs and learning force-free methods. The goal for any class is empowering clients to use force-free methods for problem-solving when training issues arise when you are not there in class to guide them. Include a copy of the HDN in take-home training packets.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Examples for Private Consultations</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Review the HDN infographic with your client during the first consulting session. Assess training needs and identify the methods you will use from the force-free training methods chart on the left side of the handout. Help address unwanted behavior with explanations of differential reinforcement, counterconditioning, and desensitization methods. Take notes on a master copy. Private consultants can identify behavioral problems needing attention and lead to the development of a treatment plan to determine which basic skills are missing from a family\xe2\x80\x99s repertoire to help the troubled dog and client. Address the needs and topics you feel most competent and comfortable teaching. For example, the client may want recommendations on nutrition and exercise. A conversation on <i>Emotional Needs</i> and trust often reveals fearful or aggressive behavior only a qualified behavior consultant can safely and adequately address. A discussion on <i>Social Needs</i> and attachment may uncover a separation/attachment issue or disorder associated with pet parents, or with other dogs in the family.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Another idea is to create a poster of the HDN<i> </i>for your facility or classroom wall. Have a print company create an unaltered, uncropped (as is) poster from a print-ready file available to force-free advocates from the author.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Examples for Veterinarians</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs (HDN) includes gentle veterinary care as an essential biological health need. As the primary contact professionals, veterinarians are in a position to make the greatest impact on the physical and psychological well-being of the dogs under their loving care. Veterinarians can take a leadership role with pet parents and other pet-related professionals in the animal welfare and force-free movement by using The Hierarchy of Dog Needs<i> </i>and the accompanying<i> Do No Harm Dog Training and Behavior</i> <i>Handbook.</i> They are encouraged to share The Hierarchy of Dog Needs with colleagues, patients, trainers, and at speaking engagements, such as in seminar presentations for veterinary conferences. Veterinarians are encouraged to refer only to force-free/<i>Do No Harm</i> dog trainers and consultants. (See Chapters 1 and 8, Gentle Veterinary Care.)</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Examples for Rescues and Shelters</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Make your rescue or shelter truly force-free by adding a copy of the HDN infographic to the take-home packet with each newly adopted dog. Post a laminated copy on the gate to each dog\xe2\x80\x99s kennel as a reminder to everyone who enters of how to use force-free handling and training techniques with the focus on meeting emotional needs and decreasing stress. Ensure that all management, staff, volunteers, and foster parents have access to a copy of the infographic as a means to educate everyone connected to your adoption agency. Post a copy on your website and social media sites.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Examples for Groomers</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Groomers may blog or offer presentations on the benefits of gentle grooming, the importance of proper hygiene, removal of fur nests that may serve as havens for bacteria, and proper nail clipping to prevent long nails from impeding a dog\xe2\x80\x99s natural walking gait or the structural functions of the spine. Use the handbook to develop a training packet that includes information about pet grooming provided in the gentle grooming sections to help the client\xe2\x80\x99s dog learn to tolerate and even enjoy grooming.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">Examples for Responsible Breeders</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Provide a copy of The Hierarchy of Dog Needs infographic in the educational and guidance packets of each new pet parent and discuss the needs and do no harm training practices you want to guarantee to your adoptees.</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent_SB"><b><i>Note:</i></b><i> The reproduction, use, or modification of the Hierarchy of Dog Needs</i><span style=" font-style: italic; font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: super;">\xc2\xae</span><i> is strictly prohibited in any product sold for profit where the primary value of the product is the reproduction itself, such as on t-shirts or coffee mugs.</i></p>\n<p id="future_directions_in_research__law__and_the_role_of_celebrities" class="P_Subheader_-16">Future Directions in Research, Law, and the Role of Celebrities</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The time has come to chart a new course. <i>Do No Harm </i>principles and ethics are fast becoming the gold standard of care throughout the dog training profession. Scientists, legislators, and celebrities are urged to take a clear and unwavering position against the physical and psychological harm our dogs suffer, pioneering the cultural change essential in creating truly dog-friendly societies. Worldwide, progressive zoos and sanctuaries have moved away entirely from using punitive and other aversive methods, even when working with large and potentially dangerous animals.</p>\n<div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">\n<div class="P_Image" style=" width: 90%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display:inline-block;"><span><img style=" width: 100%;" alt="" src="image6.jpg" /></span></div>\n</div>\n<p class="P_Normal">Dog bites are a serious and growing public safety issue and it is well-documented in scientific literature that inflicting pain is frequently a cause of aggressive behavior. Bite incidents may result from the direct administration of shock (Polsky, 2000). Aggression is not the only emotional disturbance stemming from punitive and aversive training methods. According to an article in the <i>Journal of Veterinary Behavior, </i>\xe2\x80\x9cGood Trainers: How to Identify One\xe2\x80\x9d (Overall et al., 2006), investigators placed shock collars, prong collars, and choke collars at the top of the list of equipment that causes anxiety, fear, and arousal, which often contributes to an increase in aggression. A growing number of governments in progressive animal-welfare sensitive nations ban the use of these devices on pet dogs.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Canine research scientists are encouraged to take a leadership role in the ethical treatment of companion animals. Evidence illustrates there is no place for shock, prong, choke, or other aversive variables in companion animal research. The rationale against the use of shock and positive punishment is well established in scientific literature. Dr. Karen Weigle (2019), clinical psychologist, affiliated with the University of New Hampshire spoke out on shock saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThis has gone on for this long because this is a population who cannot adequately speak for themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d Who will speak for the dogs? If not us, who? If not now, when? Professional positions opposing the use of aversives in dog training are based on both a sophisticated academic grasp of the neurochemical and behavioral mechanisms at play, and a desire to promote animal welfare in a civilized world (Michaels, 2015d). The hallmarks of leadership in science highlight the detrimental effects that painful devices and practices have on our companion animals. The advent of the Pet Professional Guild (PPG) gives medical professionals, research scientists, and other pet professionals a clear option for affiliation with an international, science-oriented organization. PPG members subscribe to No Shock, No Pain, No Choke, No Fear, No Pain and No Physical Force in dog training. It is understood that science cannot take a stand\xe2\x80\x94but scientists can.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Scientists can easily design research studies that <i>do no harm,</i> thus supporting the<i> </i>instrumental and necessary steps leading to a ban on shock devices used with pet dogs. A survey using the extensive Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ) database (Serpell, 2020), or a separately designed survey, exploring the co-relational relationship between shock training and bites would be of practical value to scientists, animal welfare advocates, trainers, and the public. A survey study based upon a collection of statistics from veterinarians on the injuries and deaths from choke and prong collars would inform and illustrate the true extent of the problem using these devices.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Scientific presentations have real world impact on audiences, and moreover, on our companion animals. Pet professionals from an array of dog-related fields often incorporate these scientific interpretations into their practices and hold them up as a gold standard. New evidence-based practices are the driving force in social commitment to animal welfare policy legislation and the subsequent enforcement of sanctions prohibiting intentional harm to dogs. Scientists who adopt a clear and ethical stand on dog handling and training can help drive social change and shape laws governing animal welfare legislation. Governmental representatives will look closely at what scientists have to say about shock, prong, choke, and dominance training practices. The adaptation of ethics driven science into law puts to rest the unwarranted justification of the use of painful devices and training methods.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Celebrity impact on cultural change is also a powerful and a much-needed force for good. The dog-loving celebrity community can be leading spokespersons for <i>Do No Harm</i> training methods. Celebrities can affect the well-being of dogs across the globe with just a few, clear, and well-spoken words about dog training methods. Employing force-free dog trainers and encouraging the production of truly dog-friendly television shows and films will further endear fans to stars and their pets.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Together a commitment to strengthening animal welfare laws and regulations based upon dog-friendly ethics will bring about a transformation\xe2\x80\x94a sea change in dog training that is long overdue. Increasing penalties for dog abuse and neglect, and developing regulation in the field of dog training ensures trainer competency and a <i>do no harm</i> ethic for dog-related activities. This will accomplish our collective goal. It is incumbent upon each of us to take a clear and unwavering stand on these issues by adopting a force-free ideology concerning the care and welfare of our dogs.</p>\n<div id="hoopla-highlight-container"></div></body>\n</html>'</p>

Marking the emergence of the force-free age in the field of dog training, The<i> </i>Hierarchy of Dog Needs<span style=" font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: super;">\xc2\xae</span><i> </i>is a logical and progressive paradigm whose time has come. The Hierarchy of Dog Needs (HDN)<i> </i>is a wholistic system of care that takes a clear and ethical stand on dog welfare needs and dog-training methods and devices. The HDN is a novel adaptation of renowned psychologist Abraham Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Hierarchy of</i> (human) <i>Needs</i> that emphasizes strengths, positivity, free will/choice, and a belief in the wholeness of animal nature (Maslow, 1943). Research shows that when biological needs, safety needs, and belongingness needs are met for social animals, they are far less likely to display abnormal behavior. The Hierarchy of Dog Needs is supported by scientific evidence as demonstrated in this handbook and makes no apologies for embracing protective ethics concerning our beloved dogs.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs infographic and this handbook provide teaching tools for all types of industry professionals and pet parents to use as a force-free alternative to the more conventional but dated teaching paradigms currently available. Anyone who interacts with or studies dogs, or any animal for that matter, can use it successfully. The HDN lists dog needs hierarchically but the levels are fluid rather than static. Once basic needs have been assessed and met, the training methods may be used in <i>any order</i> of choice, dependent upon the situation, context, and expertise of the handler.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs is a guide to animal wellness and <i>Do No Harm Dog Training. </i>The Hierarchy of Dog Needs<i> </i>was created as a guide to standards of basic care in dog welfare needs and best force-free training practices. The HDN is in use internationally by veterinarians, veterinary behaviorists, dog trainers (including working-dog and police-dog trainers), groomers, shelters, rescues, animal welfare advocates, and pet parents. The HDN has been translated into French, Spanish, Portuguese, Danish, Chinese, German, Estonian, Korean, Greek and Arabic to date, with many more requests awaiting translation.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs is a tool for animal wellness and serves as an essential companion to the <i>Do No Harm Dog Training Handbook. </i>HDN <i>Force-free Training</i> <i>Needs </i>methods and this handbook may be used for both common behavioral problems and the most challenging issues, such as housetraining, loose leash-walking, excessive barking, separation anxiety, fear, dog-dog aggression, human aggression, resource guarding, and more. It can help to identify the primary, secondary, and other problems affecting the dog and help guide the path of training.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">There is an increasingly strong dog-human bond in society and it makes sense that a more dog-friendly, dog-needs paradigm was needed and thus developed. Too often basic needs are not met or are under met. Dog needs are not considered in punitive or \xe2\x80\x9cbalanced\xe2\x80\x9d training approaches where the focus is on punishing unwanted pet dog behavior and not on dog welfare. <i>Do No Harm</i> training makes dogs\xe2\x80\x99 lives better because it is more effective, safer, and has longer lasting effects. <i>Do No Harm</i> is truly dog friendly.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs infographic is not intended to be a treatise on learning theory<i>.</i> Science has examined many different types of learning that include: Habituation, sensitization, desensitization, positive reinforcement, positive punishment, negative reinforcement, negative punishment, extinction, imitation, mimicry, and social learning. In other teaching paradigms, understanding behavior uses Skinnerian-related quadrants as a means to categorize response frequency. Placing every behavior response into a quadrant is not always helpful or the best approach to understanding emotional and behavioral modification and training needs. Only those methods that are physically and emotionally safe for dogs are included on the HDN and taught in the handbook.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The HDN pyramid infographic was designed to be a stand-alone guide covering as much critical territory for dog welfare and training in a one-page format as feasible. The HDN addresses as many primary needs and force-free training methods as possible, however, no infographic can convey all things to all pet professionals. Scientific advisor Dr. Luis Suoto Soubrier aptly points out, \xe2\x80\x9cThe main message and the paramount goal of The Hierarchy of Dog Needs are clear. By introducing further nuances and provisos, even after writing an exhaustive (and exhausting to read) set of rules, we would still, unavoidably, be simplifying reality anyway\xe2\x80\x9d (L. Suoto Soubrier, personal communication, 2015).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The joys, challenges, and responsibilities of pet parenting involve loving care and fit well with The Hierarchy of Dog Needs model. Of primary importance is the enhanced relationship the pet parent nurtures with their dog by using the HDN. Nurturing and developing social skills and confidence in your dog sets the stage for optimal well-being, using force-free training, instead of instilling fear and potentiating aggression.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal"><i>Do No Harm</i> is fast becoming the gold standard of care throughout the dog-training field. Pet parents and professionals are now applying emotional and behavioral modification methods using the <i>Do No Harm </i>model. The time has come to chart a new course making responsible dog training method the best practice.</p>\n<p id="i__the_do_no_harm_ethical_codes" class="P_Subheader_-16">I. The Do No Harm Ethical Codes</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Ethics are at the very heart of <i>Do No Harm Dog Training and Behavior Handbook</i> and the HDN. The embedded <i>Do No Harm</i> ethical code follows force-free, aversive-free, punitive-free training methods alone as best practices. To stem the tide of animal abuse in the dog training industry, canine behavior consultants are raising their voices in regulating practices in the field of dog training.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Pet Professional Guild (PPG) (2020c) is the first international, independent certifying dog training organization to take a clear, uncompromising, antithetical position on the use of shock, prong, choke, dominance, pain and fear-based methods in dog training. Members are fully vetted and must conform to a non-negotiable ethical code of conduct and standards. Members forfeit their membership status for violations of the ethical standards.

Aversive training has been associated with detrimental effects on the human\xe2\x80\x93animal bond, problem-solving ability, and the physical and behavioral health of the patient. It causes problem behaviors in normal animals and hastens progression of behavioral disorders in distressed animals. Aversive techniques are especially injurious to fearful and aggressive patients and often suppress signals of impending aggression, rendering any aggressive dog more dangerous. Aversive techniques include prong (pinch) or choke collars, cattle prods, alpha rolls, dominance downs, electronic shock collars, lunge whips, starving or withholding food, entrapment, and beating.

No single model of behavior can comprehensively understand, explain and predict behavior. The Hierarchy of Dog Needs<i> </i>however<i> </i>is multi-modal, multi-dimensional, and based upon a number of behavioral models providing a more complete and eclectic representation of learning and behavior than any one of the classic models of behavior do alone. Below are some popular <i>schools of thought</i> and theories about the nature of behavior.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">The Behavioral Model</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The Behavioral Model attributes behavior to the environment. The environment drives behavior through antecedents and postcedent consequences. Behavioral Analysis is based upon the <i>if, then contingency</i>. Behavior is learned, that is conditioned through</p>\n<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">\n<li class="P_ListItem"><p class="P_ListParagraph"><i>Classical Conditioning:</i> Associations learned by pairing one stimulus\xe2\x80\x94the antecedent, to another stimulus</p>\n</li>\n<li class="P_ListItem"><p class="P_ListParagraph_1"><i>Operant Conditioning: </i>Reinforcement or punishment also known as consequences or postcedents</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p class="P_Normal">More often than not both classical conditioning and operant conditioning occur simultaneously and are inextricably linked with each other. However, these two types of learning are typically spoken of independently so students and trainers may more easily understand the concepts of behaviorism. With this clarity, practitioners can identify the underlying principles leading to the formulation of a plan for treating a specific problem, behavior, or emotion. The researchers most notably responsible for developing these representational systems of behavior are research scientists Ivan Pavlov and B. F. Skinner.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">This model theorizes that a dog bites a person because the dog has been reinforced or punished for biting, or the dog associates the person with something that previously caused an involuntary physiological response and/or a learned aversive response.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">The Affective Neuroscience Model</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The Affective Neuroscience Model of behavior attributes behavior to functions of the brain modulated by hormones. The emotional systems model theorizes that environment, behavior, and emotion cannot be isolated from each other, resulting in the activation of multiple emotional and behavioral systems in any given schema. Some of the most notable researchers in this area include Charles Darwin, Jaak Panksepp, and Joseph E. Ledoux.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">This model theorizes that a dog bites a person because the dog is experiencing fear, panic, or rage on the neurological and hormonal levels.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">The Ethological Model</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The Ethological Model of behavior attributes behavior to evolutionary adaptive traits with a focus on field studies in natural environments. The identification of <i>Modal Action Patterns (MAP)</i>, inherited tendencies to make specific and complex responses to specific environmental stimuli, helping scientists to understand behavior. Some of the most notable researchers in this area include Charles Darwin, Konrad Lorenz, Niko Tinbergen, and Simon Gadbois.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">This model theorizes that a dog bites a person because it is adaptive to survival to bite when threatened or to compete for resources.</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_12">The Medical Model</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">The Medical Model of behavior attributes behavior to wellness or the lack thereof.

Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s Hierarchy of Needs\xe2\x80\x94The Third Force in Behavior</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent">Students of psychology are familiar with <i>The Hierarchy of </i>[human]<i> Needs.</i> The Hierarchy of Dog Needs is a novel variation of renowned psychologist, Abraham Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s Hierarchy of Needs, adapting a human model of behavior to fit dogs. Similar needs occur in all species.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Animal models of human needs are traditionally used in research where the results and conclusions are extrapolated to humans to help us understand disease and develop treatments in medicine and behavior. Pavlov developed his theories of classical conditioning using dogs as his subjects in research. Skinner developed his theories of operant conditioning using pigeons as his research subjects. The field of comparative psychology explores cross-species comparisons, including those between humans and animals (Tinbergen, 1963).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Maslow, disenchanted with the popularized behaviorist paradigm of his time, cofounded the school of thought in psychology called <i>humanism</i>, the <i>Third Force</i> that emerged subsequent to psychoanalysis and behaviorism (Leahey, 2001). During the summer of 1938, Maslow conducted anthropologic research on a Blackfoot Native American reservation that is believed to have inspired him to theorize a new understanding of the fundamental features of human nature (Taylor, 2019)<i>.</i></p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Humanistic psychology emphasizes strengths, positivism, choice, and a belief in the wholeness of animal nature. In Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s own words: \xe2\x80\x9cSelf-actualized people have the wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder and even ecstasy, however stale these experiences may have become to others\xe2\x80\x9d (Maslow, 1943, pp. 370\xe2\x80\x93396). Does this not definitively describe what we often observe in our dogs? We witness our dogs taking great joy in simple things, over and over again. Taking a (w)holistic view of the sentient dog, The Hierarchy of Dog Needs combines both wholeness and behaviorist templates for wellness and emotional and behavioral modification understanding that both mental events and previously reinforced learned behaviors are causal. Humanism asserts that the present and the future and the past influence us.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Following on the heels of Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s work and others, the former President of the American Psychological Association, and renowned research scientists, Martin Seligman, became the face of <i>Positive Psychology</i> (Seligman, 2020). He called for an alternative to psychology\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crelentless focus on the negative\xe2\x80\x9d and for research into growth, mastery and drive. Today, much research and many academic textbooks explore topics including well-being, the science of happiness, and peak performance. Seligman\xe2\x80\x99s most famous work on <i>learned helplessness</i> (Seligman, 1972) demonstrated that dogs that had previously learned that escape from shock was impossible, would not even attempt to escape once escape was on option. His breakthrough research shows that <i>mental events are causal, even in our dogs</i> (Seligman cited in Schultz &amp; Schultz, 2008).</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Maslow further developed his theory in <i>Motivation and Personality</i>, highlighting the significance of relationships<i> </i>(Maslow, 1954). <i>The Hierarchy of </i>[human]<i> Needs</i> remains a very popular framework in secondary and higher education psychology instruction and research. The nature of our relationships with our dogs deserves more attention, thus introducing this adaptation to dog care and training is a unique pleasure.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Dogs have the opportunity to reach an optimal state of well-being when all their needs are met. This is the singular objective of The Hierarchy of Dog Needs principles and procedures, standards of care and best practices. All needs highlighted in the Hierarchy of Dog Needs are interconnected. Needs are similarly dynamic in humans. Researchers find those whose needs for safety and belongingness are met are far less likely to display distraught and disordered behavior than those who have not had these needs satisfied (Schultz &amp; Schultz, 2008).</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent_SB"><b>Note:</b> While a pyramid has become a popular way to represent <i>The Hierarchy of </i>[human]<i> Needs</i>, Maslow himself never used a pyramid to illustrate his levels in any of his writings on the subject.</p>\n<div id="hoopla-highlight-container"></div></body>\n</html>'</p>

The voices taking a clear stand against pain-based collar devices and aversive control methods masquerading as dog training grow louder.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs defines <i>Standards of Care and Best Practices</i> in force-free training. Attending to animal welfare needs <i>and</i> exclusively force-free methods are setting the gold standard in emotional and behavioral modification and training. The ethical code embedded within <i>The</i> <i>Do No Harm Dog Training</i><span style=" font-style: italic; font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: super;">\xc2\xae</span><i> and Behavior Handbook </i>and the <i>Hierarchy of Dog Needs</i><span style=" font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: super;">\xc2\xae</span> (HDN) is grounded in animal welfare principles and dog-friendly dog training. By virtue of providing ethical standards and practices guidelines in the dog training field and industry, we hope to help lead the way, making life easier and more joyful for our dogs and the people who love them.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">In developing a new force-free model of best practices, we no longer leave the door open for aversive/punitive measures in dog training. The extant training models focus largely on quadrants in learning theory yet sadly, have too often been misused as a rationale and justification for the application of punitive methods in training. The ubiquitous misapplication of methods in an unregulated industry is the problem.<b> </b>Doing psychological or physical harm to a captive dog points to a lack of skill and competence on the part of the trainer. There is no justification for harsh treatment or training with dogs, or any animal for that matter, unless one\xe2\x80\x99s life or safety is in immediate danger. The methods detailed in the HDN may be used in any order without risk to the dog: <i>Do No Harm</i> methods never asks or directs the pet parent to hurt their dog psychologically or physically.<b> </b>We seek to \xe2\x80\x9cdo no harm\xe2\x80\x9d physically or psychologically to dogs under our care and training at all times.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Shock collar training is a serious animal welfare concern in the United States and across the globe. Frequently, animal abuse masquerades as dog training. How can the average pet parent be expected to make a well-informed decision with regard to behavior modification tools when so many dog trainers, misinformed professionals, and manufacturers of shock products misrepresent the true nature of their effects? There is simply no place for shock, prong, choke, or other aversive devices in companion animal training.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">In \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Shock is Not Behavior Modification,\xe2\x80\x9d principal investigator Dr. Karen Overall (2013), editor of the Journal of Veterinary Behavior states, \xe2\x80\x9cThe use of shock is not treatment for pets with behavioral concerns\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 111). The popular myth that shock \xe2\x80\x9csaves lives\xe2\x80\x9d has no evidence to support it. Indeed, nothing could be further from the truth. A hypothetical fallacy with the alternative of either shocking a dog or euthanizing a dog is a patently false dichotomy commonly posed by shock proponents. Dr. Overall states unequivocally, \xe2\x80\x9cThe use of shock does not bring dogs back from the brink of euthanasia; instead, it may send them there\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 111). Using punitive methods or devices in training can cause an increase in anxiety that often leads to further behavioral problems, resulting in pet parents relinquishing their animals to overflowing shelters. If progressive zoos are successful in changing the behavior of the animals in their care using force-free training methods alone, behavioral consultants, trainers and other professionals, ought to do the same for our pet dogs.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">In addition, dog bites are an increasingly grave public safety issue, making dog-training methods a public health concern. Bite incidents resulting from the administration of shock are not uncommon\xe2\x80\x94it is well documented in scientific literature that inflicting pain is a cause of aggressive behavior.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">The Hierarchy of Dog Needs has received a very positive and warm response from the dog loving community. It is in use by veterinary behaviorists, integrative and holistic veterinarians, gentle groomers, dog walkers, pet sitters and service dog organizations, trainers, and pet parents. It is designed for dog trainers teaching classes and those conducting private consultations. The infographic is particularly helpful to shelters, rescues, foster pet parents, and animal welfare advocates. It is in use as a teaching guide in colleges, on websites, on television, and by a growing, international base of pet parents interested in the <i>Do No Harm</i> ideology and practice of dog training.</p>\n<p class="P_Normal">Dr. Katrina Ward, DVM, remarking on her presentation of the HDN to the Australian Veterinary Association conference said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hierarchy of Dog Needs was very well received and hopefully will be taken up as a routine method of assessing needs and applying humane behavior modification\xe2\x80\x9d (as cited in Michaels, 2015/2020). Dr. Lynn Honeckman, DVM and behavior specialist in Orlando, Florida, uses the HDN to teach pre-vet students in her veterinary clinic presentations. Everyone from national crisis response human and dog trainers to working dog trainers are using it. In a television morning show featuring the Hierarchy of Dog Needs Maarja Tali, guest lecturer at Tallin University in Estonia says,</p>\n<p class="P_Block_Quote__And__Spacing_After"><i>After the basic needs are met, dogs need to feel safe and loved. Relationships are as important to dogs [as they are to humans]. So, before we start drilling or shaping or teaching or training, it is much more important that we have a good trust-based relationship with our dog. One of the most important messages here is that before we even get to training, we need to understand whether the dog is ready to learn.</i> (Tali, 2019)</p>\n<p class="P_Subheader_-_14">How This Handbook is Organized</p>\n<p class="P_No_Indent"><b>Part 1.</b> <b>The Hierarchy of Dog Needs Standards of Care and Best Force-free Practices</b> provides the theoretical foundations that support the Hierarchy of Dog Needs for each level of the pyramid and elaborates on each method of <i>Force-free Training.</i> Part 1 includes fully referenced, scientific citations for professionals and readers assuring scientific rigor.
