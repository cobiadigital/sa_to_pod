      <p class="body text-start"><p>This is the Appreciative Narrative Daily Moment. Today, a reading about the Anticipatory Principle from &ldquo;Appreciative Living&rdquo; by Jaqueline Kelm</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>Jaqueline Kelm in chapter four of &ldquo;Appreciative Living&ldquo; talks about the fourth principle of Appreciative Inquiry, &ldquo;The Anticipatory Principle which suggests the images we create in our minds about the future guide our present actions and create that very future. She writes:</p>

<p>Athletes have long known and practiced a form of future imaging called visualization. The idea of visualization is to picture something in your mind and make the experience as real as possible. [Peter] Senge writes how &ldquo;world-class swimmers have found that by imagining their hands to be twice their actual size and their feet to be webbed, they actually swim faster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Golfer Jack Nicklaus describes how he uses images:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never hit a shot, even in practice, without having a very sharp, in-focus picture of it in my head. It&rsquo;s like a color movie. First I &ldquo;see&rdquo; the ball where I want it to finish, nice and white and sitting up high on the brightest green grass. Then the scene quickly changes and I &ldquo;see&rdquo; the ball going there: its path, trajectory, and shape, even its behavior on landing. Then there&rsquo;s a sort of fade-out, and the next scene shows me the kind of swing that will turn the previous images into reality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later on in the chapter, Kelm writes about thinking about vision as a field, in the same sense that magnets have a magnetic field as if it contains power in and of itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She writes: &ldquo;This is a more difficult concept to articulate&hellip; The emotional, aesthetic, and spiritual aspects (what it feels like, what it really means to us) might be the other factors that make up the power of the visionary field.</p>

<p>The essential idea is that our images are possibly deeper and broader than some of the current thinking would suggest. Our images not only provide beacons of direction, but perhaps actually help attract congruent thoughts, people, etc. It&rsquo;s not too far of a stretch to consider the possibility that formative fields help create some of the miraculous &ldquo;coincidences&rdquo; that often emerge with strong visions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>Considering the anticipatory principle, ask yourself,&nbsp; &ldquo;What are three things I am grateful for today?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If you are able to write these down, that&rsquo;s ideal. Regardless, take a moment to visualize each gratitude, put yourself fully in that situation. What do you see? What do you hear? What do you smell?</p>

<p>Go ahead and pause this recording until you&rsquo;ve named three gratitudes.&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<p>Now consider what role you played in these moments you are grateful for.</p>

<hr />
<p>Finally, what is something, no matter how small, you can do today that will bring you joy?</p>

<p>Again, write it down if you are able, and then fully visualize what it would look like to do this activity and experience that joy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>A quote from ​​John Schaar, &ldquo;The future is not a result of choices among alternate paths offered by the present, but a place that is created&mdash;created first in the mind and will, created next in activity. The future is not some place we are going to, but one we are creating. The paths are not to be found, but made, and the activity of making them changes both the maker and the destination.&rdquo;</p>

      <p class="body text-start"><p>This is the Appreciative Narrative Daily Moment. Today, a reading about the Similtaneity principle from Part two of &ldquo;Appreciative Inquiry for Collaborative Solutions&rdquo; by Robyn Stratton-Berkessel.</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>Robyn Stratton-Berkessel in Part two of her book &ldquo;Appreciative Inquiry for Collaborative Solutions&rdquo; defines the five principles for Appreciative Inquiry. She writes:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Principle of Simultaneity -The Very First Question Starts the Change. This principle makes us aware that, as change agents, leaders, facilitators, or as parents, the very first question we ask starts the change process. The way we ask the questions determines what we find. It provides a moment of choice&hellip; Inquiry and change are simultaneous. The practice of Appreciative Inquiry involves the art of crafting and asking questions that elicit possibility and inspire images of the future. We need to consider the direction of the question. Is it life-depleting or life-nurturing?</p>

<p>For example, we are likely to receive different responses from the following two questions: (1) How was work today? and (2) What&rsquo;s the best thing that happened at work today? The first question usually elicits a response such as &lsquo;&lsquo;OK,&rsquo;&rsquo; &lsquo;&lsquo;Not bad,&rsquo;&rsquo; or &lsquo;&lsquo;Fine.&rsquo;&rsquo; It may not always be the answer, but often it is. The second question focuses the attention on &lsquo;&lsquo;the best thing that happened&rsquo;&rsquo; and the conversation opens up and will head in a totally different direction. There is also a different energy experienced in the two different responses. The first one is likely to be neutral, and the second one is likely to be more energized.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>The Simultaneity Principle is core to why we ask ourselves&nbsp; &ldquo;What are three things you are grateful for, today?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The question itself elicits positivity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perhaps gratitude could be the best three things that happened to you yesterday.</p>

<p>Write them down if you have paper and a pen nearby.</p>

<p>Go ahead and pause this recording until you&rsquo;ve named three gratitudes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<p>Now consider what role you played in these moments you are grateful for.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<p>Finally, what is something, no matter how small, you can do today that will bring you joy?</p>

<p>Again, write it down if you are able. This helps solidify the thought in your mind.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>Robyn Stratton-Berkessel includes a list of exercises to do at Appreciative Inquiry Workshops. In her Compassionate Connections worksheet, she encourages us to ask the following questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember a time when you experienced a deep connection with others and a sense of compassion filled you&mdash;you reacted in a way that strengthened your sense of being in community with others.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />
<p>&ldquo;Describe the situation. What happened?</p>

<hr />
<p>&ldquo;How were you involved&mdash;as a participant or as an observer?</p>

<hr />
<p>&ldquo;What about that experience filled you with a sense of compassionate connection to others?</p>

<hr />
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;What did you notice at the time about the behavior of others involved?</p>

<hr />
<p>&ldquo;What did you notice about yourself in this story of compassionate connection?</p>

<hr />
<p>&ldquo;What did you notice about your feelings? Where did you feel those feelings in your body?</p>

<hr />
<p>Stratton-Berkessel quotes Felix Adler who said &ldquo;To care for anyone else enough to make their problems one&rsquo;s own, is ever the beginning of one&rsquo;s real ethical development.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

      <p class="body text-start"><p>This is the Appreciative Narrative Daily Moment. Today, a reading about the Simultaneity Principle from Chapter 3 of &quot;Appreciative Living,&quot; by Jaqueline Kelm&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>Jaqueline Kelm in chapter 3 of her book &ldquo;Appreciative Living,&rdquo; describes Appreciative Inquiry&rsquo;s Simultaneity Principle. She writes, &ldquo;The internal and external questions we ask steer our thinking, attention, and images in one direction or another, which in turn directs our decisions and creates our experience. There is a saying that goes something like, &ldquo;If you keep doing what you always did, you&rsquo;ll keep getting what you always got.&rdquo; In the same vein, if we continue to ask the same questions, we&rsquo;ll continue to create the same world. We have patterns of thinking that tend to lead us down similar questioning paths.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kelm goes on to discuss all the questions we face upon waking each morning such as whether to hit the snooze button on the alarm or what to wear for the day. She writes, &ldquo;...each of our choices was an answer to an implicit question. For example, our decision about what to eat for breakfast came from an internal question that might have been, &ldquo;What do I feel like eating today?&rdquo; Or perhaps it was, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in the kitchen I can eat quickly for breakfast today?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kelm continues, &ldquo;Consider what would happen if we asked one different question in the morning such as, &ldquo;What would be the healthiest thing I could eat this morning that would leave me feeling good about myself and give me the greatest energy to start the day?&rdquo; Even if we made the same breakfast choice, it would be done with a different mindset. If we continued to ask this same new question each morning, at some point we would begin to change our actions by virtue of our attention&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>With the Simultaneity Principle in mind,&nbsp; What are three things you are grateful for?</p>

<p>Considering that whatever we focus on begins to grow. Are there moments from the last few days that you want more of?</p>

<p>For example, would you like to be eating more healthy foods? You could be grateful for a particularly healthy meal you had recently.&nbsp; If you would like to get more fit, you could be grateful for that flight of stairs you climbed the other day.&nbsp; If you want better relationships, perhaps you could recall a recent conversation with a loved one and be grateful for it!</p>

<hr />
<p>Go ahead and pause this recording until you&rsquo;ve named three gratitudes.&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<p>Now consider what role you played in these moments you are grateful for.</p>

<hr />
<p>Finally, what is something, no matter how small, you can do today that will bring you joy?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>Kelm in her book quotes the therapist, Marilee Adams, who says, &ldquo;If you ask the Right Questions before you make a choice, you will shift yourself away from automatic, repetitive cycles and toward deliberate, focused steps that will lead you toward the future you desire. The Right Questions penetrate your denial system and wake you up.&rdquo;</p>

      <p class="body text-start"><p>You&#39;re listening to the Appreciative Narrative Daily Moment. Today&#39;s reading is a case study on the power of the Simultaneity Principle from&nbsp;Chapter 4 of Appreciative Inquiry: Change at the Speed of Imagination&nbsp;by Jane Maguder Watkings, Bernard Mohr, and Ralph Kelly.</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>Watkings and fellow authors describe Apprciative Inquiry&#39;s Principle of Simultaneity as&nbsp; &quot;A realization that inquiry is change, that the first question we ask is fateful in that the organization will turn its energy in the direction of that first question, whether positive or negative; and, as a result, the seeds of change are embedded in it....&nbsp;The Principle... recognizes that inquiry and change are not separate moments, but are simultaneous. Inquiry is intervention.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They include a case study by David Shaked &quot;Perhaps one of the best examples I have to date of the Simultaneity Principle in action was a recent client project I worked on. The client, a rail company, asked [a] colleague... and me to facilitate a process improvement workshop to reduce the delays to rail services that occurred when faulty coaches were exchanged with serviced ones. The exchange, when not done correctly or in a timely fashion, causes delays to the rail service and a chain reaction of further delays to other services. At our first meeting, the head of the department&nbsp;in charge of rail performance provided us with plenty of data points about the delays, their frequency, root causes, and their great financial impact on the company. After a while, I asked our sponsor how often the orga- nization changes coaches successfully and on time? A powerful moment of silence followed. The answer our sponsor provided was &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t think we ever measured it.&rdquo; From that moment on, our conversation took a completely different direction. We were all curious to find out how often the process works well, what contributes to this success, and how we can do more of what already works well.</p>

<p>This single powerful question was the basis of the workshop we delivered...&nbsp;We inquired about best experiences, mapping the process when it works, collecting stories and data about the process at its best, and asking participants what would make it even better... The great ideas the participants came up with came from good practices they were already doing or had done in the past.&quot;</p>

<p>As you aproach difficult issues, what questions can you ask yourself and others that can flip the conversation from solving a problem to mapping and replicating when things go right?</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>Consider the Principle of Simultaneity as you think aboug three things you are grateful for today...</p>

<p>The question in and of itself is born out of the principle, but for a moment consider a problomatic situation you are going through. Instead of dwealing on the problem, think about what is a question that would positively reframe how you see the problem.</p>

<hr />
<p>What role have you played in these three things that you are grateful for?</p>

<hr />
<p>Finally, what&nbsp;is something, no matter how small, you can do today that will bring you joy?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>The Simultaneity Principle: Questions Ignite Change<br />
&bull; We anticipate what the future will be like by forming pictures in our minds, and then we live into those images.<br />
&bull; We can deliberately change the future by visualizing what we want.</p>

                Ep. 7 Simultaneity Principle from Jackie Stravos - Conversations Worth Having

      <p class="body text-start"><p>This is the Appreciative Narrative Daily Moment. Today, a reading from Chapter 4 of &quot;Conversations Worth Having,&quot; by Jackie Stravos and Cheri Torres about the Simultaneity Principle of Appreciative Inquiry.</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>In their book &quot;Conversations Worth Having,&quot;Jackie Stravos and Cheri Torres discuss how the Simultaneity Principle can improve dialogue between people. The Simultaneity Principle is the idea that &quot;Change happens the moment a question is asked or a statement is made.&quot; In other words: &quot; If our perceptions and experience change instantaneously in response to how we use or interpret words and actions, then it makes sense to stay open and ask questions.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stravos illustrates this question by asking her readers to participate in a little mental exercise. She writes, &quot;To experience [the Simultaneity Principle] yourself, think of the last time you made a mistake in front of your boss or colleagues or were chastised publicly... How does reliving that experience affect you physically, emotionally, and mentally? Now, recall the last time you were praised publicly or were acknowledged at work for excellence. Stop for a moment again and bring that memory in. How does reliving that affect you physically, emotionally, and mentally?</p>

<p>How fast did your state change? You probably found that it was simultaneous with the suggestion. That shows the Simultaneity Principle. Inquiry and change, for all intents and purposes, are simultaneous events in a conversation.&quot;</p>

<p>For any given circumstance there can be two or more conflicting stories. In one story, we can tell ourselves that all forces are aligned against us achieving our goal. In the second story, we see all the ways in which we may be closer than ever to reaching that goal. Which story turns up in a conversation depends on the frame you are using and the questions you ask.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>With the Simultaneity Principle in mind,&nbsp; What are three things you are grateful for?</p>

<p>Perhaps you can reframe a negative story you&#39;ve been telling itself and reframe it by identifying positive aspects of it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<p>Now consider what role you played in these things.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<p>Finally, what is something, no matter how small, you can do today that will bring you joy?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>Stravos tells the story of Gabriella, an organization development consultant, who was having a conversation with a provost of a large university who was having trouble implementing a learning management system that promised to engage students and improve student outcomes.&nbsp; The University had invested so much time and energy into the new system but he told Gabriella that he was having trouble getting the faculty on board. &quot;It&#39;s so frustrating&quot;, he said, &quot;Especially for the students!&quot;</p>

<p>She responded with a depreciative comment &quot;That&#39;s pretty typical of faculty, isn&#39;t it? Why are they always so resistant to change?&quot; Then she thought about Appreciative Inquiry and the Simultaneity Principle. So she asked the provost, &quot;Are there any faculty who are on board with what you are trying to do?&quot;&nbsp; Stravos writes, &quot;Before she even completed the sentence, the provost brightened, stood taller, smiled, and with enthusiasm and a completely different tone declared, &#39;Oh yes, the College of Management is completely on board! They&rsquo;ve adopted this wholeheartedly!&#39; Then he went on to describe all the things the faculty were doing and the successes their students were having.&quot;</p>

<p>All Gabriela did was ask a generative question about the positive opposite of what the provost was saying. Her question literally flipped the conversation <em>in the moment</em>.</p>

<p>Her story illustrates how easy it can be to turn a conversation around with a simple generative question. It shows that <em>change begins the moment you ask a question or make a comment</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She also discovered there were (at least) two stories about the faculty and the project. In one story, faculty are resistant to technology. In the other, faculty are embracing it. Which story turns up in a conversation depends on the frame you are using and the questions you ask.</p>

      <p class="body text-start"><p>This is the Appreciative Narrative Daily Moment. Today&#39;s reading is about The Simultaneity Principle of AI&nbsp;from Chapter 3&nbsp;of The Joy of Appreciative&nbsp;Living by Jaqueline Kelm</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>In Appreciative Inquiry, The Simultaneity Principle says the&nbsp;very act of inquiry creates change, and the language we use in our questions can influence the direction and outcome of that change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jacqueline Kelm in her book &quot;The Joy of Appreciative Living,&quot; writes, &quot;[The Simultaneity Principle] suggests that change begins simultaneously in the moment we ask a question, so the questions we ask are really important. They instantly focus our thinking in one direction over another, so asking questions is one of the most powerful tools we have for making deliberate changes in our lives.&quot;</p>

<p>This is a key reason why Kelm suggests starting&nbsp;a daily habit of naming one thing you can do that day, no matter how small, that will bring you joy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She writes, &quot;The point of this exercise is not for you to come up with a concrete answer, but for you to see how questions can direct your attention and shift your thinking in the moment they are asked. Rather than simply mulling over your day, you shift your attention to think about what would bring you joy....&nbsp;Do you see how asking a question like this every day could reprioritize your thinking and bring happiness to the forefront? Can you imagine how it would gradually shift your focus to more of the things that bring you joy?</p>

<p>Principle fits into this approach and how it emphasizes the role of language and inquiry in shaping our experiences and the direction of change. You might also discuss some of the practical applications of the Simultaneity Principle, such as how it can be used to facilitate organizational change and development, and how it can help organizations and individuals to focus on their strengths and achieve their goals.</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>With the&nbsp;Simultaneity Principle in mind, think of&nbsp;three things you are grateful for.</p>

<p>Remember, just by naming them, you are reframing your mind to a positive mindset.&nbsp; Chose anything...</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s an unexpected positive result of an action you took... perhaps it&#39;s the satisfaction of completing a project... Or maybe just a moment of clarity or relief...</p>

<hr />
<p>What was your role in these three things</p>

<hr />
<p>Finally, what&#39;s one thing you can do today, no matter how small, that will bring you joy?</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>A participant in Kelm&#39;s study about the effects of asking these daily questions over several months told her. &quot;The one most impactful insight from the study was the thought that I truly do create my reality based on the questions I ask myself and the answers I think to those questions.

      <p class="body text-start"><p>This is the Appreciative Narrative Daily Moment. Today&#39;s reading is about The Simultaneity Principle of AI&nbsp;from Chapter 3&nbsp;of The Joy of Appreciative&nbsp;Living by Jaqueline Kelm</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>In Appreciative Inquiry, The Simultaneity Principle says the&nbsp;very act of inquiry creates change, and the language we use in our questions can influence the direction and outcome of that change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jacqueline Kelm in her book &quot;The Joy of Appreciative Living,&quot; writes, &quot;[The Simultaneity Principle] suggests that change begins simultaneously in the moment we ask a question, so the questions we ask are really important. They instantly focus our thinking in one direction over another, so asking questions is one of the most powerful tools we have for making deliberate changes in our lives.&quot;</p>

<p>This is a key reason why Kelm suggests starting&nbsp;a daily habit of naming one thing you can do that day, no matter how small, that will bring you joy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She writes, &quot;The point of this exercise is not for you to come up with a concrete answer, but for you to see how questions can direct your attention and shift your thinking in the moment they are asked. Rather than simply mulling over your day, you shift your attention to think about what would bring you joy....&nbsp;Do you see how asking a question like this every day could reprioritize your thinking and bring happiness to the forefront? Can you imagine how it would gradually shift your focus to more of the things that bring you joy?</p>

<p>Principle fits into this approach and how it emphasizes the role of language and inquiry in shaping our experiences and the direction of change. You might also discuss some of the practical applications of the Simultaneity Principle, such as how it can be used to facilitate organizational change and development, and how it can help organizations and individuals to focus on their strengths and achieve their goals.</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>With the&nbsp;Simultaneity Principle in mind, think of&nbsp;three things you are grateful for.</p>

<p>Remember, just by naming them, you are reframing your mind to a positive mindset.&nbsp; Chose anything...</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s an unexpected positive result of an action you took... perhaps it&#39;s the satisfaction of completing a project... Or maybe just a moment of clarity or relief...</p>

<hr />
<p>What was your role in these three things</p>

<hr />
<p>Finally, what&#39;s one thing you can do today, no matter how small, that will bring you joy?</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>A participant in Kelm&#39;s study about the effects of asking these daily questions over several months told her. &quot;The one most impactful insight from the study was the thought that I truly do create my reality based on the questions I ask myself and the answers I think to those questions. I am in &shy;control of my happiness, and asking the right questions makes all the difference in the world.&quot;</p>

      <p class="body text-start"><p>This is the Appreciative Narrative Daily Moment. Today&#39;s reading is about the power of weekly visioning from Chapter 10 of The Joy of Appreciative Living by Jaqualine Kelm.</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>The power of the 5 Principles of Appreciative Inquiry in daily life can particularly be seen when practiced on a daily basis. This is why we make the gratidude list every morning.&nbsp; Jaqualine Kelm in her book The Joy of Appreciative Living suggests another exercise to do weekly.&nbsp; She calls it the &quot;Weekly Visioning&quot;</p>

<p>Kelm writes, &quot;The purpose of this exercise is to get clear about what joy looks like for you, and to create ideal mental pictures in your mind that act as beacons you can gravitate toward. It also gives you some insight into answering the daily question&quot; (what are you grateful for and what you can do to today to bring you joy).</p>

<p>Kelm suggests getting into a comfortable spot, get your self into a good mood by thinking about something lovely, then start writing about your ideal, most joy filled life.</p>

<p>Kelm writes, &quot;Pretend that a miracle occurred and your perfect, ideal, &shy;joy-&shy;filled life manifested right now before your eyes. Write down every glorious piece you can imagine about what this ideal life looks like at the highest level. You only have fifteen minutes, so you have to keep the vision big. How is your health? Your career? Your relationships? Your home? List the ideas as they stream through your mind. Let your deepest hopes and desires come forth and dream big about your perfect, happy life. Pretend it is really happening now, and feel the joy inside of you as you write.&quot;</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>If you don&#39;t have time to write for 15 minutes, think now on what your most joy filled life would look like.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Think about who it includes, and what your relationships look like. Think about where you are physically, emotionally, spiritually, and financially. Think about what you are doing on a day to day basis. What keeps you busy?&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<p>What is something, no matter how small, you can do today that will pull you in the diretion of that vision?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>Kelm writes: Gaining clarity about what you want in the future takes time, even once you have mastered the visualization exercise. It is a gradual process of defining and refining as you go. While it can be hard at first to figure out what you really want in your life, it&rsquo;s a whole lot better than riding along in the back seat.</p>

      <p class="body text-start"><p>This is the Appreciative Narrative Daily Moment. Today&#39;s reading is about The Poetic Principle of Appreciative Inquiry&nbsp;from Chapter 4&nbsp;of &quot;Conversations Worth Having&quot;&nbsp;by Jackie Stravos and Cheri Torres</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>The poetic principle is one of the five core principles of Appreciative Inquiry.&nbsp; Essentially it says, &quot;Every person, organization, or situation can be seen and understood from many perspectives.&quot;</p>

<p>In her book &quot;Conversations Worth Having,&quot; Jackie Stravos explains how using the poetic principle in conversations can drastically impact how the conversation goes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She writes. &quot;If our beliefs and the stories we make up about people and situations influence how we understand and how we act, then it makes sense to talk about and pay attention to what&rsquo;s working, what&rsquo;s best, and what&rsquo;s possible.&quot;&nbsp; Later she adds, &quot;Which story turns up in a conversation depends on the frame you are using and the questions you ask.&quot;</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>As you name three things you are greatful for today, think about how you may use the poetic principle to reframe what may have been perceived as a negative event, may have turned out to be something postiive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Purhapse a difficult time in your past has given you resilience... maybe getting caught in a&nbsp;bad traffic jam, gave you time to call and talk to a loved one... What&#39;s something that innitially felt negative, but upon reflection can be reframed as something positive for which you are grateful?</p>

<hr />
<p>After you&#39;ve named those three things. Can you identify the role you and others played in making them come about?</p>

<hr />
<p>Finally, What is something, no matter how small, you can do today that will bring you joy?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>Later in the chapter Jackie tells a story of Daniel who works with troubled youth coming from gangs. One day, instead of focussing on the misbehavior and acting out of the kids, he began seeing how being in the gang had taught these kids valueable life skills that he could cultivate.</p>

<p>Jackie writes: &quot;Daniel realized these kids actually <em>had</em> teamwork and leadership skills. They used them to be a tight gang. He just hadn&rsquo;t looked for them. Over time, his questions surfaced skills in each young man, and some of them discovered they were strong leaders. He now saw his job as helping them realize how capable they were and cultivating their strengths to be effective leaders in the community.&nbsp;Over the next year, Daniel&rsquo;s struggle turned into joy as he watched the potential of these kids emerge.&quot;</p>

<p>Hold your viewpoint lightly. Make room for new perspectives.</p>

      <p class="body text-start">  </p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>Today&#39;s Appreciative Narritive thought comes from chapter 3 of Jackaline Kelm&#39;s book &quot;The Joy of Appreciative Living.&quot;</p>

<p>For good or ill, we are subjective creatures. We shape our entire lives around what we&nbsp;think&nbsp;we see, but the fact is we see what we want to see. Our beliefs and thinking patterns direct our attention toward what we believe is important or enjoyable or interesting to pay attention to, and this process is not going to change anytime soon. The point is to be aware that we are all biased by nature, and that our perspective is just that: one perspective. We need to hold our beliefs and truths open to new information and further investigation.</p>

<hr />
<p>What&#39;s one thing you are grateful for?</p>

<p>It could be time you spent with a pet... something particular about your home...&nbsp; a phone call with a family member...</p>

<hr />
<p>Think of a second thing you are grateful for.</p>

<hr />
<p>Now a third</p>

<hr />
<p>Now think about what role you played in these three things.</p>

<hr />
<p>What is something, no matter how small, you can do today that will bring you joy?</p>

<hr />
<p>One of Kelm&#39;s study participants said:</p>

<p>&quot;I learned that joy doesn&rsquo;t have to be big. Joy can be found in small, daily things. I found joy in floating in a lake with tiny dragonflies landing on my arms. I found joy in having something &shy;super-&shy;yummy planned for dinner, or cuddling with my &shy;three-&shy;year-&shy;old. How blessed I am!&quot;</p>

      <p class="body text-start"> </p>
      <p class="body text-start"><p>In Jaqualine Kelm&#39;s book, Appreciative Living she further lays out the constructionist principle:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Life is not experienced in a vacuum. We simultaneously integrate our past and present beliefs as we construct a new reality with others. As we hear over and over from different sources that being responsible is a good way to live, we begin to view that as &quot;truth.&quot; We come to believe that it is better to follow the rules, do what we promise, and adhere to the standards and norms of our society. We carry that truth into our next experience and act accordingly. It is only &quot;truth&quot; for us, from our relative perspective and framework of understanding. It will be viewed differently by others.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What&#39;s one thing you are grateful for?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It could be a conversation you had... a few moments of walking in the sun... a particular feeling...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Name another thing...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Name a third...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now think about what role you played in these three things.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What is something, no matter how small, you can do today that will bring you joy?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It could be ride a bike, bake cookies, play some music...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s Driving Your Conversations?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Appreciative Inquiry teaches human interactions rest on a set of five principles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first is the Constructionist Principle: Understanding, interpersonal dynamics, and ultimately our social reality are created through language and in conversation.</p>

<p>In other words: What we believe to be true is informed by and evolves through conversation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;If the way we talk together influences understanding, interpersonal dynamics, and teams, departments, and organizations (Constructionist Principle), then it makes sense to hold our beliefs lightly and to ask questions and make room for both new knowledge and new meaning.</p>

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<p>Think back on yesterday and name three things you are grateful for?&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Did you have a great conversation&hellip; an interpersonal connection&hellip;&nbsp; a moment of joy&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pause the show if you need more time.</p>

<hr />
<p>Think back on what the role you played in&nbsp; making these moments&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally: What&rsquo;s one thing you could do today, no matter how small, that will bring you joy?</p>

<p>This could be playing an instrument, heading to the gym, or even just turning on your favorite song and really dancing to it.</p>

<hr />
<p>Stravros writes: A meaningful and successful life comes from following your passions and heart, acting from strengths, and using creative thinking to inspire possibility. Therefore, talk about and inspire passion, discover strengths, and make room for creative potential.</p>

<p>In&nbsp; Appreciative Inquiry, the first principle is the Constructionist Principle; its essential idea is that we continuously create or construct stories about what is happening in our lives. The reality we experience is completely subjective, and it is seen through the unique lenses and filters through which we view the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>James Branch Cabell said &ldquo;The optimist proclaims we live in the best of all possible worlds, and the pessimist fears this is true.&rdquo; What world do you live in?&nbsp; A better question may be: what world do you&nbsp;<em>want</em>&nbsp;to live in?<br />

<p>Think back on yesterday and name three things you are grateful for.</p>

<p>Finally:&nbsp;What&rsquo;s one thing you could do today, no matter how small, that will bring you joy?</p>

<p>Quote from one of Jaqualine Kelm&rsquo;s study participants:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The possibilities for framing a day are endless. If we don&rsquo;t make a conscious effort to decide... if we leave it up to the winds... it&rsquo;s like seaweed in the ocean. It goes wherever the current takes it. We need to make conscious choices and deliberately frame our day.&rdquo;</p>
