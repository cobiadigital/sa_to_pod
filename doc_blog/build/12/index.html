To personally acknowledge all who have supported me in this endeavor would exceed limitations of space and time, but it is my joy to thank a few of them by name.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Pride of place goes to my mentors. Barry Hankins oversaw an early version of the manuscript and first drew my attention to Baylor\xe2\x80\x99s history PhD program with his delightful book <span class="italic">Jesus and Gin,</span> which also inspired this book\xe2\x80\x99s title (along with Kristin Kobes Du Mez\xe2\x80\x99s <span class="italic">Jesus and John Wayne</span>). Garth Rosell first inspired me to seek a doctorate in history and prompted me to study prohibition and religion through an independent study. Along with Garth, thanks also to Gwenfair Adams and David Hempton, whose letters of recommendation got me into Baylor\xe2\x80\x99s PhD program.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Studying at Baylor was a privilege and a delight that laid the foundation for this work. Work on a research paper for Kim Kellison\xe2\x80\x99s class on the US South in 2012 focused my doctoral research. Many other professors there, including Beth Allison Barr, David Gawrych, Barry Hankins, Philip Jenkins, Thomas Kidd, Michael Parrish, James SoRelle, Joan Supplee, Joe Stubenrauch, Julie Sweet, and Andrea Turpin, also broadened my perspective and took a genuine interest in my welfare not only as a scholar, but as a person. My fellow graduate students, including but not limited to Scott Anderson, Prisca Bird, Ryan Butler, Alyssa Gerhardt Craven, Tim Grundmeier, Paul Gutacker, Jacob Heiserman, Joel Illif, Adina and Sam Kelley, Elise Leal, Ben Leavitt, Matt Millsap, Jonathan Riddle, Nick Pruitt, Paul Putz, Lynneth Miller Renberg, David Roach, and Brady Winslow, shared with me an even deeper sense of comradery, along with countless sources, insights, and evenings that immeasurably enriched my research and my time in Waco, Texas. Sic \xe2\x80\x99em Bears!</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Colleagues at my current academic home, North Greenville University, have been an inspiration and encouragement to me in this project, particularly my dean, H. Paul Thompson, whose interest in our shared niche field of race, religion, and prohibition led to a job and a close friendship. Professors Feliccia Smith and Paul Yandle, along with other faculty and many students, remind me by word and deed that scholarship must always be in the pursuit of justice. Thanks to student workers Leslie Meyers and Micah Stevens, who helped with research and editing.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The research for this book would not have been possible without financial and archival support. Baylor University\xe2\x80\x99s Graduate School and History Department not only covered the costs of my tuition but also aided travel for research and academic conferences. Baylor\xe2\x80\x99s Presidential Scholarship and Guittard Fellowship further helped me focus on my studies. The Danforth Center for Religion and Politics at Washington University in St. Louis funded my trip to their 2014 Beyond the Culture Wars Conference, whose participants offered valuable feedback on my then-nascent research. Thanks to numerous people at Baylor University\xe2\x80\x99s Texas Collection for the Burney Parker Research Fellowship and at Southern Methodist University\xe2\x80\x99s Bridwell Library for the Visiting Scholar Fellowship and Scholar in Residence accommodations, which greatly enriched my research. The Southern Baptist Historical Library and Archives made possible my research in Nashville with their Lynn E. May Jr. Study Grant, and their staff were also exceedingly helpful, particularly then-director Bill Sumners and current director and archivist Taffey Hall. Thanks to Johnana Clark, Shirley Bowie, and Luther Oelke at the Region 4\xe2\x80\x93South Archives of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America in Seguin, Texas. Particularly during the 2020 pandemic, the Chronicling America newspaper archives sponsored by the Library of Congress and the National Endowment for the Humanities were invaluable. Other online sources such as the Hathi Trust and Archive.org were likewise helpful throughout the process to examine countless digitized sources at leisure. My gratitude goes to all those librarians and archivists whose names I have forgotten yet whose aid led to wonderful discoveries.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">This book owes much to feedback I received when presenting portions of it at conferences and in journals. Discussions on several panels at the American Society of Church History, the Alcohol and Drugs Historical Society, and the Conference on Faith and History pushed me to develop these ideas further. Some key findings in this book were presented for the first time in an article in the <span class="italic">Journal of Southern History</span> in November 2017, which likewise helped me rethink and restructure my argument. Michael Parrish, one of my professors at Baylor, gave invaluable help with getting this work published. Thank you.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Faith and family powered me through this project. In traditional Christian fashion, I thank God\xe2\x80\x94Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\xe2\x80\x94for giving me insight, stamina, and energy to complete this work and for reminding me that even within Divinity there is diverse community, which has inspired me to seek out a plurality of perspectives in my research and to heed marginalized voices. I thank my parents, Nancy and Philip, who taught me that there need be no contradiction between strong faith, sound scholarship, and self-giving love. And who else but Catherine\xe2\x80\x94best of wives and best of women\xe2\x80\x94could be such an unstinting supporter, faithful friend, and exacting editor, all while managing an editing business and writing fantasy novels. Her input has improved the manuscript and my life in countless ways.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Finally, a disclaimer. The views presented in this book may not represent the views of everyone who contributed to this project, including my place of employment. Many have enriched this text with their conversations, suggestions, and insights. What faults remain are fully mine.</p>\n</body></html>\n'</p>
