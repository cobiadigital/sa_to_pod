RAYNER\xe2\x80\x99S LETTER</span> of March 17, 1887, was political dynamite. He wrote to Dr. Benajah Harvey Carroll, a fellow Baptist minister and the white leader of the Texas drys, that to win the upcoming election on statewide prohibition he needed Black support. Rayner, a self-professed \xe2\x80\x9cProhibitionist by deep religious principle\xe2\x80\x9d and fellow Baptist, warned Carroll that \xe2\x80\x9cthe negro vote is quite an item and will play an important part in the coming election.\xe2\x80\x9d Rayner, an African American himself, advised Carroll how best to win the Black vote: enlist as many African American ministers and newspapermen as possible.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en1" href="part0020.html#ch02en1e">1</a></span> Soon thereafter, prominent Black ministers, including African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Bishop Henry McNeal Turner of Georgia, were campaigning in the state for prohibition. Rayner himself campaigned heavily in Robertson and surrounding counties.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en2" href="part0020.html#ch02en2e">2</a></span> As in North Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee, drys in Texas in the 1880s initially sought to achieve prohibition through a multiracial coalition of voters. Interracial cooperation seemed to be working until early June, when wets obtained Rayner\xe2\x80\x99s secret letter and published it. One wet editor accused, \xe2\x80\x9cThat Rayner letter and the presence of Bishop Turner needs, nay, demands explanation,\xe2\x80\x9d and concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cPolitics which mix up religions [<span class="italic">sic</span>] like that are dark and peculiar, and Dr. Carroll ought not to be in the business.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en3" href="part0020.html#ch02en3e">3</a></span> As with other prominent prohibition votes that year around the South, the Texas vote led to loss for the drys and resulted in white backlash to multiracial politics.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Prohibitionists in the 1880s South fought an uphill battle not only against racial conventions but also against gender norms. While southern traditions in the postbellum period put white women on a pedestal yet denied them basic civil rights, drys drew much of their support from women, both white and Black, and many drys advocated for women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage. Women used the temperance movement to denounce abuse in the home and justify public activism as a necessary extension of their domestic sphere. Black women also sought racial uplift, middle-class solidarity, and feminine respectability by making common cause with their white sisters for prohibition. The intertwined social constructions of race and gender in the conservative Bourbon South militated against prohibition, particularly when it aligned with political empowerment for women and African Americans. Prohibition was too radical and transgressive for the 1880s South. To understand why the interracial prohibition campaigns of the 1880s mostly failed, however, one must first consider an essential piece of context: the racial history of prohibition in the Old South.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Origins of Southern Prohibition</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s slow progress in the Bourbon South stemmed in part from its old association with controlling nonwhite bodies. Long before most white southerners seriously contemplated limiting the access of fellow whites to alcoholic beverages, colonial legislatures in the South passed laws prohibiting the sale of alcohol to African American slaves. In the wake of the Stono Rebellion the year before, South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s Slave Code of 1740 included such a provision. Section XXII strictly forbade a retailer to \xe2\x80\x9cgive, sell, utter or deliver to any slave, any beer, ale, cider, wine, rum, brandy, or other spirituous liquors, or strong liquor whatsoever, without the license or consent of the owner, or such other person who shall have the care or government of such slave.\xe2\x80\x9d Punishment for violation included payment, increasing for repeated offenses, which could result in up to three months of jail time.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en4" href="part0020.html#ch02en4e">4</a></span> In this respect, the colonial South was not distinctive from the colonial North. Massachusetts also had a law against selling spirits to any \xe2\x80\x9cNegro, Indian or mulatto slave\xe2\x80\x9d in 1751.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en5" href="part0020.html#ch02en5e">5</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Aside from slaves, colonial prohibition laws also targeted Amerindians. Despite believing that moderate alcohol consumption was \xe2\x80\x9cwholesome and necessary\xe2\x80\x9d for whites, British colonists across North America sought \xe2\x80\x9cto reduce and finally prohibit the sale or gift of intoxicating liquors\xe2\x80\x9d to indigenous peoples. According to Anti-Saloon League statistician and historian Ernest H. Cherrington, alcohol wrought \xe2\x80\x9chavoc\xe2\x80\x9d among Amerindians, indicating \xe2\x80\x9cclearly and emphatically their possibilities for evil\xe2\x80\x9d and proving that \xe2\x80\x9cit was all but impossible for the Red Man to drink in what the white man considered moderation.\xe2\x80\x9d Colonists cared about this issue regarding Amerindian alcohol abuse only because \xe2\x80\x9cserious trouble with the savages . . . menaced the safety of the whites.\xe2\x80\x9d Besides indigenous peoples, servants (including slaves) were also targeted for alcohol bans, since their drunkenness stole the labor that \xe2\x80\x9cbelong[ed] to others.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en6" href="part0020.html#ch02en6e">6</a></span> The only colony that banned ardent spirits (distilled beverages) outright was Georgia, but even that was linked to class: it began as a penal colony, and the restrictions on alcohol were lifted in the 1750s, when restrictions on slavery were also lifted.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en7" href="part0020.html#ch02en7e">7</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The Old South had a few temperance organizations, but they failed to achieve much success in laws restricting alcohol sales, except for slaves.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en8" href="part0020.html#ch02en8e">8</a></span> And, as Lee L. Willis put it, slaves across the region \xe2\x80\x9calready lived under prohibition\xe2\x80\x9d before emancipation.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en9" href="part0020.html#ch02en9e">9</a></span> Tennessee\xe2\x80\x99s 1838 \xe2\x80\x9cquart law,\xe2\x80\x9d the first ban on selling small quantities of intoxicating beverages in the United States, had only a modest impact. The quart law allowed purchases of larger quantities, resulting in effective prohibition for the poor but not the rich. The state legislature repealed the quart law in 1846 and replaced it with the old licensing system, along with a requirement that liquor dealers had to swear to not sell to slaves, allow gambling, or sell drinks on Sundays. The quart law was briefly reinstated between 1856 and 1857 before finally being consigned to oblivion.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en10" href="part0020.html#ch02en10e">10</a></span> As with the quart law, Mississippi enacted in 1839 a \xe2\x80\x9cgallon law\xe2\x80\x9d to ban liquor sales of less than a gallon. The law\xe2\x80\x99s severe penalties\xe2\x80\x94a $200 fine and at least a week in jail for a first offense, $500 and a least a month in jail for subsequent convictions\xe2\x80\x94prompted an angry mob to burn the law\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor, Henry S. Foote, in effigy in Jackson. The gallon law was replaced in 1842 by a law allowing sales by a licensed liquor seller\xe2\x80\x94who had to be \xe2\x80\x9ca free white person.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en11" href="part0020.html#ch02en11e">11</a></span> Texas acquired an early taste for dry laws as well. In 1843, the Republic of Texas passed the first local option law in North America, allowing cities and counties to vote to ban alcohol for themselves. An 1845 Texas law banned saloons, though it was never enforced and was repealed by 1856. Prohibition laws in the Antebellum South were limited in scope, faced tremendous backlash, and were invariably repealed.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en12" href="part0020.html#ch02en12e">12</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">When racial chattel slavery was overthrown by the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution, former Confederates sought to salvage white supremacy through Black Codes to control Black labor\xe2\x80\x94and drinking habits. A Mississippi law from November 1865 stated that any person of color who was convicted of selling \xe2\x80\x9cspirituous or intoxicating liquors\xe2\x80\x9d would be fined between ten and one hundred dollars and could be imprisoned up to thirty days, while any white person convicted of providing a person of color with weapons or an intoxicating drink could be fined up to fifty dollars and faced imprisonment of up to thirty days. Likewise, a South Carolina law in December 1865 prohibited African Americans from owning even part of a business that distilled or sold spirituous liquors or being employed as a distiller or seller of those drinks. While that act punished a person of color who engaged in such business with beating or hard labor at the discretion of a district judge or magistrate, there was no punishment for a white distiller who employed that person of color. Slave codes sought to control slaves\xe2\x80\x99 drinking habits through coercing white collaborators while benignly neglecting free Blacks, yet the Black Codes directly targeted alcohol access for all people of color.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en13" href="part0020.html#ch02en13e">13</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Given the racial connotations of alcohol control in the South, it is unsurprising that the prohibition movement originated in the North and initially met resistance in Dixie. In the early nineteenth century, the temperance movement was one of many causes, including abolitionism, developed and advanced by the evangelical reform nexus in the North. The Union victory in the Civil War brought some of these northern reform-minded evangelicals South through organizations such as the American Tract Society, African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church (AMEZ), American Baptist Home Mission Society, the American Missionary Association, and the National Temperance Society. While most of these groups were organized by whites, the AME and AMEZ were Black-led denominations, and all of these groups sought to provide African Americans in the South with spiritual and practical assistance. Missionary schools, public schools, churches, and fraternal lodges all encouraged Black leaders to embrace the convictions of the northern evangelical reform nexus, including alcohol prohibition, thus linking racial uplift with interracial reform.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en14" href="part0020.html#ch02en14e">14</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">While laws targeting Black drinking disappeared under Congressional Reconstruction in the late 1860s and early 1870s, dry groups formed around the South. In addition to many of the antebellum reformist organizations mentioned above, other groups also came South and had chapters throughout the region by 1870, including: United Friends of Temperance, International Order of Good Templars, Sons of Temperance, Band of Hope, and Temperance Council. Dry newspapers such as Houston\xe2\x80\x99s <span class="italic">Temperance Family Visitor</span> (around 1871) cropped up around the South, and other local press gained sympathy for the movement.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en15" href="part0020.html#ch02en15e">15</a></span> The prohibitionist impulse was not limited to African Americans and so-called carpetbaggers but began taking root among southern whites.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">After Reconstruction, white-supremacist Democrats wrote new state constitutions, many of which introduced local option laws. These laws, promoted by Jeffersonian Democrats and prohibitionists, empowered cities, counties, and other locales to prohibit or allow alcohol within their borders, usually by plebiscite. This arrangement produced a patchwork quilt of fully wet, bone-dry, and mixed \xe2\x80\x9cmoist\xe2\x80\x9d locales across southern states, with towns and counties sometimes flipping back and forth between banning and legalizing alcohol. Some states resisted local option, such as Tennessee, which did not include it in the 1870 constitution, and the state\xe2\x80\x99s governor in 1873 vetoed a local option law.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en16" href="part0020.html#ch02en16e">16</a></span> Yet other states embraced the Jeffersonian arrangement of local option votes. Alabama had twenty-two dry counties by 1874. The 1876 Texas Constitution permitted local option laws, finding first success when Jasper County voted to go dry in December of that year.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The local option laws in several southern states, though modest in practical scope, marked a turning point for prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s racial dimension in the region. For the first time in southern history, blanket prohibition laws were imposed with votes from all the people they affected, including people of color. African Americans in the South, who had for generations been told by white overlords what they could not drink, could now vote in elections determining not only their own right to drink, but the rights of their white neighbors as well. For Black voters, postbellum prohibition contests offered a heady cocktail of freedom and power.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Meanwhile, many southern white evangelicals also came to appreciate the empowering possibilities and moral necessity of prohibition reform by the 1880s. While the connection of prohibition with causes such as abolition impeded its progress among southern whites before the Civil War, the end of slavery and then the end of Reconstruction by 1877 encouraged white evangelicals to focus less on securing white dominance through Democratic rule (which had already been achieved) and more on expanding their moral authority. Despite persisting regional denominational divides among Methodists and Baptists, many white evangelical clergy and laity sought to cooperate with their northern co-religionists to institute a sort of moral reconstruction in the decades after 1877. By the 1890s, white southern evangelicals\xe2\x80\x99 priorities mirrored the evangelical reform nexus, with most southern federal legislators backing laws against gambling and polygamy and for closing the World\xe2\x80\x99s Fair on Sunday.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en17" href="part0020.html#ch02en17e">17</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">This transformation among white evangelicals took time. Robert Wuthnow argues that Texas churches were for most of the nineteenth century too focused on bringing order to a wild frontier by building institutions and instilling moral character to invest much in direct political activism, but by the early twentieth century, the landscape had changed. Fostered especially by Baptists and Methodists, the notion of liberty of conscience became a major part of civil religion, and both wets and drys claimed to uphold individual rights. Wets argued that each person should have free reign over whether to drink, but the church had no place demanding laws to force compliance with religious teaching. Drys, however, defended individuals\xe2\x80\x99 right to live upright lives free from alcohol addiction and moral degradation. Prohibitionists also argued that saloons corrupted politics through their collusion with political machines, that brewers and distillers were dominated by \xe2\x80\x9cforeigners\xe2\x80\x9d who undermined American liberty, and that leading dry organizations were not churches but nonsectarian and nonpartisan. By framing themselves as warriors for heaven and the homeland above the everyday fray of politics, drys increased their political clout and cultural influence as they sought to reshape the South in their own image.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en18" href="part0020.html#ch02en18e">18</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-a">Threats to Bourbon Rule: African Americans and Women</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">The interracial prohibition movement in the South occurred in the broader context of other political threats to conservative Democratic rule in the South. During Reconstruction, African Americans experienced a new birth of freedom through emancipation, citizenship rights, public education, modest economic opportunities, the franchise, and\xe2\x80\x94for the select few\xe2\x80\x94offices in local, state, and federal government. Though white supremacists denounced \xe2\x80\x9cblack rule\xe2\x80\x9d during Reconstruction, African Americans very rarely made up more than a minority of state and local officers in any given state at any time. Nonetheless, the elevation of Black Americans from slaves to state officials in a few short years surprised everyone in the South. Coupled with support from white Republicans\xe2\x80\x94both northern-born \xe2\x80\x9ccarpetbaggers\xe2\x80\x9d and southern-born \xe2\x80\x9cscalawags\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94African Americans held the balance of political power in every state that underwent Congressional Reconstruction.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Since Republican rule in the Reconstruction-era South depended upon interracial coalitions of whites and Blacks, white-supremacist Democrats employed terrorism, intimidation, trickery, and fraud to wrest control in state after state. By 1877, all the formerly Confederate states were under Democratic control and remained so until the mid-twentieth century, nearly a century later. While Republicans still held some seats in localities, state legislatures, and even Congress, their representation dwindled. Southern white Republicans debated whether to have an interracial \xe2\x80\x9cBlack and tan\xe2\x80\x9d party or go \xe2\x80\x9clily-white\xe2\x80\x9d to have a chance at power, and eventually the lily-whites won out. By the 1890s, interracial politics in the South appeared finished.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Before southern Republicans had completed their abandonment of African Americans, the most serious opposition to conservative Bourbon rule in the early post-Reconstruction South came from a movement outside of the Republican Party. Founded by the former Confederate general and railroad tycoon William Mahone, the Readjuster Party from 1879 to 1883 dominated Virginia state politics. When the Virginia Republican Party collapsed in the state after the election of 1877, the dominant Conservative Party (essentially Democrats), called \xe2\x80\x9cFunders\xe2\x80\x9d for their intent to pay the state\xe2\x80\x99s debt in full at a fixed interest rate, dominated the state legislature and angered poorer Democrats who sought to refinance the state\xe2\x80\x99s debt and so reduce the burden of repayment on taxpayers. Mahone saw an opportunity to win over disaffected Democrats and disorganized Republicans by forming a new party, named Readjusters because of their commitment to readjusting payment of the state\xe2\x80\x99s debt. In addition to controlling the state legislature, the Readjusters elected five men to the US House, two to the US Senate\xe2\x80\x94Mahone in 1880 and Harrison Holt Riddleberger in 1882\xe2\x80\x94and a governor, William Evelyn Cameron. While limited to Virginia, this new party posed the most serious challenge at that time to Bourbon rule anywhere in the South.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en19" href="part0020.html#ch02en19e">19</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The Readjusters not only challenged the economic order but also promoted interracial political cooperation. In addition to other issues, the Readjusters abolished public whippings and ended Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s poll tax, both of which disproportionately burdened African Americans. By 1881, one-third of delegates to the statewide Readjuster convention were African Americans, and the white delegates mingled with their Black compatriots on terms of casual equality. As Nicole Meyers Turner observes, Mahone courted support from Black churches, who in turn played a crucial role in providing margins of victory for the Readjusters in the 1881 governor\xe2\x80\x99s election. But no good thing lasts forever. The Readjusters lost heavily in the 1883 elections when Democrats rallied most of the state\xe2\x80\x99s whites around the banner of white supremacy, and Readjusters lost their political clout in subsequent votes. Mahone\xe2\x80\x99s 1885 bid for governor likewise resulted in defeat. Like the Populist-Republican Fusionists in North Carolina in the 1890s, Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s Readjusters were a potent interracial political threat to Bourbon Democratic rule, and white supremacists put down the threat ruthlessly.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">A lesser but potential threat to white-only Democratic rule in the 1880s South was the nascent Prohibition Party. Founded in 1869 by members of the Independent Order of Good Templars, the National Prohibition Party originated in northern states and has fielded a presidential candidate ever since 1872, making it the oldest extant national third party in the United States. However, the Prohibition Party never gained much traction in the South because most southern white drys were Democrats. They saw other parties as a potential threat to white-only rule by splitting the vote and giving racial minorities the power to swing elections. B. H. Carroll, a faithful Democrat, represented this \xe2\x80\x9cnon-political\xe2\x80\x9d strain of dry activism in the South, though he worked with Black allies such as Rayner to win African American votes in special prohibition elections. By contrast, Carroll\xe2\x80\x99s friend and fellow Southern Baptist minister, J. B. Cranfill, was a \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical\xe2\x80\x9d prohibitionist because he backed the Prohibition Party. Though Carroll\xe2\x80\x99s stance, by far the more typical of white southern drys, sought to distance prohibition from partisan politics, Carroll\xe2\x80\x99s articles for Cranfill\xe2\x80\x99s newspaper in the 1880s helped wets paint all prohibitionists as anti-Democratic.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en20" href="part0020.html#ch02en20e">20</a></span> While the specter of the prohibition question splitting the white vote and giving a decisive role to Black voters frightened some white southerners, it roused African Americans who saw an opportunity to regain the political clout they enjoyed during Reconstruction.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Looking back from the perspective of 1920, the ASL\xe2\x80\x99s Ernest H. Cherrington concluded that the Prohibition Party could never have succeeded as a party but succeeded in its great cause. From his perspective, the Prohibition Party founders \xe2\x80\x9cwere not politicians; they were crusaders.\xe2\x80\x9d While \xe2\x80\x9cPartyism\xe2\x80\x9d depends upon \xe2\x80\x9copportunism\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cattract the largest number of voters,\xe2\x80\x9d the Prohibition Party faithful \xe2\x80\x9cnever knew the meaning of policy, prudence, or diplomacy.\xe2\x80\x9d He further reflected that party loyalty was too strong. \xe2\x80\x9cChristian voters who are favorable to prohibition refuse nevertheless to leave the political party with which they are affiliated and vote for a new party, although that party may advocate the thing in which they believe.\xe2\x80\x9d Though the Prohibition Party failed, they laid the groundwork for others to finish the work through \xe2\x80\x9ca great non-partisan political movement\xe2\x80\x9d that allowed \xe2\x80\x9cmen to remain in their own political parties and yet give political expression to their Prohibition sentiment.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en21" href="part0020.html#ch02en21e">21</a></span> Yet the Prohibition Party stood not only for bans on alcohol, but also on suffrage for the most reliably dry demographic: women.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Women\xe2\x80\x99s Christian Temperance</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Women turned the nation\xe2\x80\x99s attention to temperance in the 1870s and 1880s. A dramatic combination of prayer and social action took place in the \xe2\x80\x9cwoman\xe2\x80\x99s crusade,\xe2\x80\x9d when Eliza Jane Thompson led dozens of women on a tour of Ohio towns in December 1873 and early 1874 to kneel, pray, and sing in front of saloons until they shut down. This \xe2\x80\x9cWhirlwind of the Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d as Frances Willard later called it, led directly to the creation of the Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in 1874. Originally led by Annie Turner Wittenmyer, the WCTU grew to over a thousand chapters around the nation in five years.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The WCTU had focused exclusively on anti-alcohol activism until 1879, when Frances Willard became president and broadened the organization\xe2\x80\x99s focus to include women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage. Willard justified the controversial goal of votes for women as a necessary means of \xe2\x80\x9cHome Protection\xe2\x80\x9d from the abuse, neglect, and family decline wrought by drunken husbands and fathers. Frances Willard, a devout Methodist, believed the idea was God-given during a prayer. Under her leadership, hundreds of thousands of women across the nation, including many culturally conservative women, joined in an activist movement for the twin radical reforms of women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage and alcohol prohibition. The activism of Christian women suggested a holy alliance between women\xe2\x80\x99s activism and the explicitly Christian purification of culture.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en22" href="part0020.html#ch02en22e">22</a></span> While the first wave of temperance activism had little impact on the South, this second wave begun by the WCTU finally began making serious inroads in the US South.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Many women, both Black and white, despite not having the right to vote, also campaigned for prohibition, though for different reasons. White women drys were divided between radicals like Willard and conservatives, who dominated the WCTU in the South. In 1881, Willard made a tour of the South, including North Carolina during a statewide prohibition election, mobilizing WCTU women to advance the twin goals of prohibition and women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage. \xe2\x80\x9cEverywhere the Southern white people desired me to speak to the colored,\xe2\x80\x9d Willard recalled, but her aims differed from her white Democratic hosts. Willard desired to \xe2\x80\x9cliberate the suppressed colored vote\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdivide the white vote on the issues\xe2\x80\x9d and make a partisan \xe2\x80\x9crealignment\xe2\x80\x9d uniting drys North and South.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en23" href="part0020.html#ch02en23e">23</a></span> In short, Willard advocated for a multiracial Prohibition Party to challenge Republicans and Democrats alike.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Willard\xe2\x80\x99s radical advocacy for the Prohibition Party led to the founding of a nonpartisan WCTU by Judith Ellen Foster. The first woman admitted to practice law in Iowa in 1872, Foster served as a delegate to the first WCTU convention in 1874 and rose to become a legal advisor to the organization by 1880. Though like Willard she was a Methodist and a proponent of women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage, Foster objected to Willard aligning the WCTU with the Prohibition Party for a simple reason: she was a dedicated Republican. In protest of its support for the Prohibition Party, she resigned from the national WCTU in 1884 and soon became the president of the Iowa state chapter. In 1888, she founded the Woman\xe2\x80\x99s National Republican Association and served as its president until her death in 1910. Frustrated by the WCTU\xe2\x80\x99s continued support for the Prohibition Party, she led the Iowa state chapter to split from the national WCTU in 1889 and founded a Non-Partisan National WCTU in 1890. The latter group never posed a serious threat to the dominance of the main WCTU, and the two groups reconciled after Willard\xe2\x80\x99s death in 1898. Though temporary, the split revealed the difficulty of holding a third party together around prohibition when women could advance their interests within the two-party system.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en24" href="part0020.html#ch02en24e">24</a></span> While northern white women like Foster sought to link prohibition with the Republican Party, most southern white women sought to tie their cause to the Democratic Party, which stood for white-supremacist rule.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">For their part, many Black women sought prohibition not only for \xe2\x80\x9cHome Protection\xe2\x80\x9d from alcoholic men but also for racial uplift. The WCTU offered a respectable forum for activism and represented middle-class womanhood. For women subject to both sexual and racial double standards, asserting their Victorian morality while organizing for social reform alongside prominent white allies (particularly northern radicals like Willard) could seem very attractive. One leading Black voice in the North Carolina WCTU was Sarah Dudly Pettey, who electrified mixed-gender crowds with her oratory. One Black man cited her as a fine example of \xe2\x80\x9cwomanly womanhood\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca brilliant Frances Willard.\xe2\x80\x9d In short, African American women joined the WCTU primarily to assert their equality with middle-class Christian whites.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en25" href="part0020.html#ch02en25e">25</a></span> While they were not opposed in principle to interracial politics and women\xe2\x80\x99s enfranchisement, which the Prohibition Party supported, many Black women preferred to back the Republican Party, which offered more practical avenues for racial uplift.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">More conservative southern white women, meanwhile, seemed more interested in preserving racial hierarchy through the Democratic Party even as they reached out across the color line for votes on prohibition. For example, the white women running a prohibition club meeting in a Methodist church in Concord, North Carolina, in June 1881 invited Black women\xe2\x80\x94to segregated seating in the balcony.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en26" href="part0020.html#ch02en26e">26</a></span> The ordering spoke loud and clear: white women wanted support from Blacks, but only as inferiors. After the 1881 statewide vote, the WCTU in North Carolina organized white and Black chapters, resulting in a state structure in which chapters of both races interacted as equals. However, as Glenda Elizabeth Gilmore has observed, southern white women saw African American women as their inferiors. By 1883, when Willard returned to the state, she anointed white supremacy by how she reorganized the local chapters into a statewide structure. All Black chapters were shunted into a department called \xe2\x80\x9cWork amongst the Colored People,\xe2\x80\x9d which was led by a white woman.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en27" href="part0020.html#ch02en27e">27</a></span> Formerly engaging as near-equals, Black women in the WCTU were now treated as objects of missionary work and racial uplift under white supervision: separate and clearly unequal.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">An 1889 schism in North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s WCTU illustrated the difficulties of interracial cooperation on prohibition. Since the \xe2\x80\x9cWork amongst the Colored People\xe2\x80\x9d was founded in 1883, the department head, Rosa Steele, was a white New England\xe2\x80\x93born Methodist. She moved south when her husband, Professor Wilbur Steele, took a position teaching at a Black school. He later took a leading role in the state\xe2\x80\x99s Prohibition Party, and the couple sometimes dined with Black friends, for which the white press attacked him as \xe2\x80\x9cSocial Equality\xe2\x80\x9d Steele.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en28" href="part0020.html#ch02en28e">28</a></span> Despite these credentials for interracial work, Rosa Steele adopted a paternalistic approach, critiquing Black chapters that organized and operated without white oversight, though in many cases no white women would volunteer for those positions. In 1888, Steele invited Sarah Jane Woodson Early, the Black superintendent of the national WCTU\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cColored Work for the South,\xe2\x80\x9d to North Carolina. After five weeks of Early\xe2\x80\x99s campaign (funded by Black women), fourteen Black WCTU chapters stood strong around the state. Encouraged by Early\xe2\x80\x99s example and wearied by years of second-class treatment, these chapters seceded from the white-controlled state WCTU in 1889 and formed \xe2\x80\x9cWCTU No. 2.\xe2\x80\x9d They intentionally \xe2\x80\x9cavoided using the word colored\xe2\x80\x9d in their name because they \xe2\x80\x9cbelieve[d] all men [were] equal.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en29" href="part0020.html#ch02en29e">29</a></span> The No. 2 held their own statewide conventions and reported directly to the national WCTU as an equal of the white state group.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en30" href="part0020.html#ch02en30e">30</a></span> Racial uplift and equality, more than unity with whites on prohibition, guided Black women on prohibition in the 1880s South.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">As with male drys in other southern states, most dry men in Tennessee affirmed patriarchal politics and distanced themselves from claims that they supported votes for women. Wet papers called the WCTU a \xe2\x80\x9cgreat moral fraud,\xe2\x80\x9d claimed that its members were \xe2\x80\x9ccoquetting with politicians,\xe2\x80\x9d and warned that drys sought women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage. One dry Tennessee newspaper responded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe women of Tennessee have no desire whatever to vote, and female suffrage has no place in the wishes of the prohibitionist of Tennessee.\xe2\x80\x9d Since prohibition was \xe2\x80\x9cpurely and simply a fight of the home against the saloon,\xe2\x80\x9d it was \xe2\x80\x9cperfectly natural that the sympathies of every good woman in Tennessee should be for prohibition, and that they should use their united influence for its success.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en31" href="part0020.html#ch02en31e">31</a></span> For white dry southern men in the 1880s, the association of prohibition with women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage was a political embarrassment, and they sought to distance themselves from women\xe2\x80\x99s political empowerment.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Nonetheless, branches of the \xe2\x80\x9cradical\xe2\x80\x9d WCTU under Frances Willard spread throughout the region after her 1881 tour of the South. Local WCTU unions arose in every southern state by 1883, while state unions took shape in Tennessee in 1881; in Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Texas, 1883; and in Alabama by 1884. These organizations addressed issues from \xe2\x80\x9ctemperance Bible reading\xe2\x80\x9d to work with the press and \xe2\x80\x9cwork among the colored people.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en32" href="part0020.html#ch02en32e">32</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Even more than lobbying for prohibition, the WCTU enjoyed some of its greatest impact through the indoctrination of children in churches and schools. Temperance discourses in the nineteenth century had proclaimed that alcohol abstinence was needed \xe2\x80\x9cto save the youth of our land from falling into the cruel bondage of strong drink,\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en33" href="part0020.html#ch02en33e">33</a></span> and the temperance movement had advanced this kind of education through sermons, books, and lesson plans from the 1840s to the 1920s.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en34" href="part0020.html#ch02en34e">34</a></span> The WCTU not only produced a flood of their own instructional material from the 1870s on but also pressured groups such as the International Sunday School Committee (ISSC), which was initially indifferent to their cause in 1881, to adopt it by 1887.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The Alabama state WCTU demonstrated how southern women could influence male-led denominations to join their cause. In 1885, the Alabama Baptist State Convention, with its 8,927 students in 249 Sunday school classes, endorsed the WCTU\xe2\x80\x99s plan for quarterly temperance lessons. Two years later, WCTU lessons appeared regularly in Southern Baptist periodicals around the nation. While the northern-based Methodist Episcopal Church (MEC) had embraced temperance lessons in 1880, Southern Methodists (MECS) from the North Alabama Conference in 1885 warmly received the WCTU missives and pledged to \xe2\x80\x9cteach temperance from the pulpit, in the Sunday-school, and from house to house until public opinion is properly educated.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en35" href="part0020.html#ch02en35e">35</a></span> Building on such pressure from states across the South, the MECS as a whole took a similar tack in 1886, and quarterly publications of the MECS included those lessons by 1887.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Presbyterians in Alabama proved more difficult to persuade. They took no direct action in 1885 on the WCTU\xe2\x80\x99s pleas, and Presbyterian promises in 1886 to produce explicit temperance lessons in denominational publications did not materialize until 1893. This delay came in part because Presbyterians sought to distance themselves from Methodists and Baptists, who retained fewer connections to Christian tradition than the old-fashioned Reformed faith of Presbyterians. They did, however, follow the ISSC\xe2\x80\x99s materials for Sunday school, so they effectively deployed some temperance education starting in 1887. In addition, the state WCTU worked with groups such as the Loyal Temperance Legions, Bands of Hope, and Kindergarten Schools to reach children beyond the church walls.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en36" href="part0020.html#ch02en36e">36</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Perhaps the most important area of the WCTU\xe2\x80\x99s reach was educating children in public schools. Mary Hanchett Hunt, who headed the WCTU\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Scientific Instruction, led the national effort to indoctrinate children in public education against alcohol by lobbying state legislatures to require anti-alcohol instruction. Hunt\xe2\x80\x99s moral crusade reaped remarkable dividends. By the 1880s, most states in the nation had compulsory temperance education, and by 1901 every state had it three times a week, indoctrinating twenty-two million children. Yet this battle was fought and won state by state at different rates. The Alabama WCTU, for instance, petitioned the state legislature for seven years, from 1884 to 1891, before it relented and required \xe2\x80\x9cinstruction on the evil effects of alcohol on the body and mind.\xe2\x80\x9d By 1908, nearly 259,000 white children and more than 127,000 Black children were being taught the horrors of alcohol in state-run schools.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en37" href="part0020.html#ch02en37e">37</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Hunt\xe2\x80\x99s curricula for students included abundant anti-alcohol material, some of it factually inaccurate and calculated to terrify children.

Yet Atlanta went through a pair of referenda in 1885 and 1887 that turned the city dry for a spell and then returned it wet. The first major contest in the region, however, was an 1881 vote on statewide prohibition in North Carolina (<span>see <a class="nounder" href="part0012.html#tab01">table 1</a></span>).</p>\n<p class="table-title" id="tab01"><b class="calibre2">Table 1.</b> Major Prohibition Events in the US South, 1880s</p>\n<p class="images"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre3"/></p>\n<p class="table-source"><span class="italic">Sources:</span> Connor, ed., <span class="italic">A Manual of North Carolina Issued by the North Carolina Historical Commission for the Use of Members of the General Assembly Session 1913,</span> 1019\xe2\x80\x9320; Robert Plocheck, \xe2\x80\x9cProhibition Elections in Texas\xe2\x80\x9d; Endersby, \xe2\x80\x9cProhibition and Repeal,\xe2\x80\x9d 506; \xe2\x80\x9cProhibition Vote in Tennessee,\xe2\x80\x9d <span class="italic">New York Times,</span> October 18, 1887, 9; Thompson, <span class="italic">\xe2\x80\x9cA Stirring and Most Significant Episode,</span>\xe2\x80\x9d 184\xe2\x80\x9387, 233, 235.</p>\n<p class="table-note"><span class="italic">Note:</span> As with other tables, statistics on some Texas elections missing in Plocheck are provided by Endersby.

In 1879, the Good Templars there moved the Southern Methodists to pass a resolution urging a state law banning liquor, and the state\xe2\x80\x99s Southern Baptists pushed for a similar measure the next year. Due to a recent tax cut for alcohol sellers, prohibition sentiment was on the upswing in the state. North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic Party had enough drys in the state legislature in early 1881 to push for a statewide vote on banning alcohol by law. The vote took place on August 4, turning the summer into an all-out contest about booze.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en41" href="part0020.html#ch02en41e">41</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The question cut against the grain of party lines, and Democrats were the most divided. The state\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic governor, Thomas Jordan Jarvis, expressed support for prohibition while denouncing any effort to divide white Democratic rule. As a speaker at the North Carolina State Prohibition Convention in May 1881, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf this movement means to organize a political party, I do not go with it, but if it means to do the good work of eradicating vice, I go with it heart and soul.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en42" href="part0020.html#ch02en42e">42</a></span> Soon after the election, a South Carolina newspaper claimed that \xe2\x80\x9cdecent government\xe2\x80\x9d depended on \xe2\x80\x9ckeeping the whites solidly united\xe2\x80\x9d for the Democrats, but prohibition divided whites and strengthened the position of Blacks, who would elect legislators bringing \xe2\x80\x9cshame and disgrace\xe2\x80\x9d to the region.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en43" href="part0020.html#ch02en43e">43</a></span> One paper noted in May that the impending vote in North Carolina was \xe2\x80\x9ctearing both political parties in twain.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en44" href="part0020.html#ch02en44e">44</a></span> The prohibition question threatened politics as usual in the South.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">At first, it seemed that North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s Black vote would rally around prohibition in 1881, but by the election they went overwhelmingly wet. On June 25, a local paper noted: \xe2\x80\x9cEvery colored newspaper in North Carolina\xe2\x80\x9d save one \xe2\x80\x9cfavors prohibition.

John Campbell Dancy, a Black politician, newspaperman, and popular temperance advocate from Tarboro, North Carolina, refused to campaign for the prohibition bill because \xe2\x80\x9ca very large majority\xe2\x80\x9d of his fellow Republicans were wet, and \xe2\x80\x9cunder no circumstances would he fight the authorities of his party.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en47" href="part0020.html#ch02en47e">47</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Mr. Israel Braddock Abbott, a newspaper editor in New Bern and a former member of the state house, echoed Dancy. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a prohibitionist . . . yet I am a Republican, and stand, first by my party, then secondly by prohibition.\xe2\x80\x9d Since the State Republican Committee opposed the bill, Abbott committed to using \xe2\x80\x9call my influence against the prohibition bill\xe2\x80\x9d and believed that he and every other \xe2\x80\x9ctrue Republican\xe2\x80\x9d would always stand by the party \xe2\x80\x9cunder any and all circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d The same newspaper reporting their views observed that, just weeks earlier, placards advertising dry events \xe2\x80\x9cwere out in full blast\xe2\x80\x94but at this writing we cannot hear of a single Prohibition speaker save Rev.

Outside the South, Republicans\xe2\x80\x94from leadership to the rank and file\xe2\x80\x94championed prohibition, and the Prohibition Party was more likely to siphon votes from the GOP. After all, the infamous jibe that Democrats were the party of \xe2\x80\x9cRum, Romanism, and Rebellion\xe2\x80\x9d came from a New York Republican in 1884. However, partisan loyalties on alcohol flipped in the South. In 1881 North Carolina, a Missouri paper noted that the \xe2\x80\x9ccurious thing about this Southern prohibition\xe2\x80\x9d is that it appeared to be \xe2\x80\x9caltogether a Democratic idea.\xe2\x80\x9d Democrats were divided on the issue while Republicans\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnearly all of them, white and black\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94opposed it, and the Prohibition Party chiefly threatened Democrats rather than Republicans.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en55" href="part0020.html#ch02en55e">55</a></span> At least in 1881 in the South, rum and Republicanism were allies.</p>\n<p class="x-b">ATLANTA, 1885 AND 1887</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Four years later in neighboring Georgia, however, a coalition cut across partisan and race lines to enact prohibition in Atlanta, one of the South\xe2\x80\x99s largest cities. On November 24, 1885, Henry McNeal Turner, the AME\xe2\x80\x99s most prominent bishop, addressed a crowd of more than five thousand prohibitionists. Most of them, like Turner, were African Americans preparing to vote the next day on banning saloons in the city. In that election, Turner proclaimed, Black Americans were \xe2\x80\x9con trial before the country to see whether they will vote as honest, sober men or whether they can be purchased with money and mean liquor.\xe2\x80\x9d Rather than submit to the chains of corruption by white saloon men, Turner urged them to vote dry so that \xe2\x80\x9cif Abraham Lincoln looked down from heaven[,] he would not be ashamed of the people whom he set free.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en56" href="part0020.html#ch02en56e">56</a></span> The crowd went wild. The next day, Turner\xe2\x80\x99s version of Lincoln would have been proud: the final vote gave drys a margin of victory of just 229 votes out of 7,429 cast.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en57" href="part0020.html#ch02en57e">57</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">For the first time since the end of Reconstruction, freely cast Black votes in Atlanta determined the margin of victory for a major policy issue. That election was, to borrow the title of H. Paul Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s book, \xe2\x80\x9ca stirring and most significant episode\xe2\x80\x9d in race relations in the South. Unlike in North Carolina in 1881, white votes were evenly divided on the issue. Similar municipal prohibition votes, which divided white Democrats and allowed African Americans to cast decisive votes, appeared throughout the South in the 1880s, including in Greenville, South Carolina.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en58" href="part0020.html#ch02en58e">58</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">After African Americans in neighboring North Carolina voted overwhelmingly wet in 1881, why did most Black voters in Atlanta four years later support prohibition? The simplest answer is that Black voters believed that voting dry would better benefit their race. Bishop Turner pointed out in his speech that a vote for prohibition was a vote for Black manhood, proving in the sight of God and man that African American voters were pure and upright, fully deserving human and civil rights alongside the \xe2\x80\x9cbetter sort\xe2\x80\x9d of whites.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">After the vote, it took time for prohibition to take effect, and its results were disappointing for Black voters hoping for visible racial uplift. June 1, 1886, marked the official start of prohibition in Atlanta, though enforcement of the law proved more difficult than voting for it. Despite the promise of great change, prohibition resulted in remarkably little change to the status quo. While white drys valued Black votes, they were more intent on keeping whites in power than advancing prohibition. This sense of betrayal led many African Americans to take a disillusioned attitude toward prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s promises of interracial cooperation. By 1887, a campaign to repeal prohibition took place, and this time wets prevailed, 5,183 votes to 4,061 for the drys. The results of the 1887 vote revealed that Black voters once again decided the election, though this time they went wet.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en59" href="part0020.html#ch02en59e">59</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-b">TEXAS, 1887</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Fulton County\xe2\x80\x99s temporary dry victory by a multiracial coalition in November 1885 inspired similar campaigns for statewide prohibition from neighboring Tennessee to faraway Texas. Not content to stay in Atlanta, Turner also campaigned in Texas and Tennessee in 1887 to spread the dry gospel. Along with many other Black drys, Turner urged the \xe2\x80\x9cbest people\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94namely, those who embraced middle-class Victorian morality, including prohibition\xe2\x80\x94to unite across the race line. Even without John Rayner\xe2\x80\x99s letter encouraging Carroll to invite Turner to Texas for the prohibition campaign, Bishop Turner likely would have come there anyway to support racial uplift by aligning Black citizenship rights with prominent white prohibitionists.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">In Texas, Baptists played major roles for prohibition. Dry leaders in 1886 appointed white Baptist minister James Cranfill to their committee on Texas Baptists. Most importantly, the Baptist preacher and former Confederate soldier B. H. Carroll became head of the drys in 1887.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en60" href="part0020.html#ch02en60e">60</a></span> With Carroll\xe2\x80\x99s blessing, Rayner enlisted African American Baptists for the prohibition cause.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en61" href="part0020.html#ch02en61e">61</a></span> Prominent African American pastors, including the national leader of the AME, Bishop Henry M.

At the same time, Rayner had warned Carroll that many African American Baptist ministers and newspapermen would side with the brewers if not first secured by the drys.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en62" href="part0020.html#ch02en62e">62</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">While some white drys embraced interracial politics, some preferred the politics of racial exclusion. Cranfill, a white Baptist and member of the Prohibition Party, sabotaged Carroll\xe2\x80\x99s inclusive approach with a racist editorial, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Native White Man,\xe2\x80\x9d in his newspaper. The editorial sought to rally \xe2\x80\x9cthe native, white, Anglo-Saxon elements of the South\xe2\x80\x9d for prohibition against the \xe2\x80\x9cbo-dutch,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cnigger,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clow-bred foreigners.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en63" href="part0020.html#ch02en63e">63</a></span> Even after an official apology by Carroll, Cranfill\xe2\x80\x99s rhetoric helped push every ethnic and racial minority into the wet camp.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en64" href="part0020.html#ch02en64e">64</a></span> Interracial bridges were easier to burn than to build.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Perhaps the weightiest voice against prohibition for white southerners was the high priest of the Lost Cause, Jefferson Davis. Texas\xe2\x80\x99s current US senator and former governor, Richard Coke, had served on Davis\xe2\x80\x99s staff during the war and coaxed him to offer his input on the prohibition question in Texas. Davis replied with an open letter. While he admitted that temperance was good and alcoholism a great evil, prohibition tended \xe2\x80\x9cto destroy individual liberty and moral responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d and would effectively \xe2\x80\x9ceradicate one evil by the substitution of another,\xe2\x80\x9d which was even \xe2\x80\x9cmore fatal\xe2\x80\x9d than the other.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en65" href="part0020.html#ch02en65e">65</a></span> In short, the cure of prohibition was worse than the disease of drunkenness. The letter dominated news around the state for several days, and all parties believed it played a major role in the amendment\xe2\x80\x99s defeat. A similar letter by Davis spelled the same fate for prohibition in Tennessee. The former president of the late Confederacy was not merely political, but almost a religious leader for many southerners who embraced Lost Cause ideology. For them, Davis was more authoritative on the question than any preacher or politician, no matter how venerable.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en66" href="part0020.html#ch02en66e">66</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Wets deftly appealed to the white majority. The wet state committee\xe2\x80\x99s statement of principles claimed that prohibition was \xe2\x80\x9cat war with the fundamental principles of Anglo-Saxon civilization.\xe2\x80\x9d Wets believed that white male supremacy was threatened by prohibition, and they were not entirely wrong. Not only did some drys promote women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage, but the Prohibition Party threatened white supremacy by dividing white votes and undermining one-party rule.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en67" href="part0020.html#ch02en67e">67</a></span> Wets also attacked drys\xe2\x80\x99 interracial collaboration. In early June, wets obtained and published Rayner\xe2\x80\x99s secret letter to Carroll, claiming that African Americans were the brains behind the drys. One wet editor demanded explanation for the Rayner letter and Bishop Turner\xe2\x80\x99s political activism and denounced Carroll for mixing religion and politics, particularly across the race line.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en68" href="part0020.html#ch02en68e">68</a></span> \xe2\x80\x9cThe success of the [wet] cause has never been doubtful for one moment,\xe2\x80\x9d the Waco <span class="italic">Daily Examiner </span>crowed, \xe2\x80\x9csince Parson Rayner came to Parson Carroll\xe2\x80\x99s help with advice as to how to run the campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en69" href="part0020.html#ch02en69e">69</a></span> Since both Black and white clergy fueled the drys\xe2\x80\x99 grassroots movement, they were susceptible to accusations of uniting church and state as well as undermining white supremacy.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en70" href="part0020.html#ch02en70e">70</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">At the same time, African American speakers effectively mobilized many Black voters for the wets. Black Republicans such as J. C. Akers of McKinney and Melvin Wade stumped East Texas, giving wet speeches and debating drys. A former slave, Wade became a prominent Dallas businessman and led several state Republican conventions. According to him, white drys wanted to \xe2\x80\x9ccurtail your freedom,\xe2\x80\x9d but Blacks voted wet out of their \xe2\x80\x9cpassion for freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d Akers and Wade\xe2\x80\x99s contention that prohibition would further limit their already compressed liberty resonated with African American Republicans who recalled their days in bondage, their losses since Reconstruction, and the importance of liberty in American Christianity.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en71" href="part0020.html#ch02en71e">71</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The connection of liquor with liberty in the 1880s took clearest expression in Robert Reed Church Sr., the South\xe2\x80\x99s first African American millionaire, who began his Memphis career as a saloon owner. Like Ida B. Wells, Church was born in Holly Spring, Mississippi, to a slave mother. Church, however, was raised by his white father, owner of a steamboat fleet on the Mississippi River, where he gained entrepreneurial experience. By 1865, he had settled in Memphis and acquired a saloon while his wife, Louisa Ayres Church, opened beauty parlors. A white mob shot Church and left him for dead during the 1866 Memphis riot, but he survived and was determined to remain. During the 1878 yellow fever epidemic, when so many fled Memphis that the city was demoted to a taxing district, he stayed and was the first person to buy a $1,000 bond to help restore the city\xe2\x80\x99s charter. By 1887, Church had established himself as a philanthropist of stature in the city, and by the end of the century, he owned numerous saloons. While Church made most of his fortune in banking and real estate, his continuing connections to saloons linked beer with Black entrepreneurship, resilience, and racial uplift and doubtless inspired many African Americans to vote wet in 1887.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en72" href="part0020.html#ch02en72e">72</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Black activists, both wet and dry, used prohibition referenda as opportunities to divide the white Democratic vote and give Black voters a meaningful role in major political campaigns, especially at the state level. Norris Wright Cuney, the African American leader of Texas Republicans from 1884 to 1896, was offered a seat on Texas\xe2\x80\x99s anti-prohibition executive committee in 1887, but he declined the honor to avoid pushing Democrats into the dry camp. As he put it, he sought to avoid \xe2\x80\x9cgiving the anti-prohibition movement political recognition and sanction, which has been so far avoided on both sides.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet his personal stance on alcohol was not ambiguous. He drank claret each night before sleeping, and the invitation to join the wets showed his equally unambiguous public stance. Ever the politician, Cuney was shrewd enough to realize that his presence on the wet executive committee would likely push more racist whites into the dry camp and so be counterproductive.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en73" href="part0020.html#ch02en73e">73</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Texas wets issued a twenty-six-page pamphlet that advanced two old Christian ideas: limited government and temperance as moderate use rather than outright prohibition. First, it extolled a license system at the local level as the most effective way to limit drunkenness, particularly by encouraging lighter drinks such as beer and light wine against distilled liquors. Second, it denounced prohibition as counterproductive because the impulse to drink was natural and healthy, and any attempt to ban such drinks would only encourage citizens to subvert the law and overdrink. The pamphlet also cited authorities from James Madison to Alexander Hamilton and linked prohibition to then-radical movements like free love and women\xe2\x80\x99s rights. Above all, it argued that prohibition was tyranny: it took away God-given liberties.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en74" href="part0020.html#ch02en74e">74</a></span> Ideals of local government and classical Christian beliefs in moderation over abstinence persisted with a critical mass of southern voters in the 1887 elections.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Wets\xe2\x80\x99 shrewd arguments resonated with most Texan voters. The election on August 4, 1887, delivered a predictable result: 220,627 wet votes to 129,270 dry. That was a margin of more than 90,000 wet votes, or more than 63 percent of the vote going wet, nearly two to one.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en75" href="part0020.html#ch02en75e">75</a></span> While their victory was not as dramatic as in North Carolina six years earlier, wets demonstrated that they could still dominate the vote in the South. Yet another statewide prohibition election in the South was just a few months away in Tennessee.</p>\n<p class="x-b">TENNESSEE, 1887</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">After their failure in Texas, southern drys in 1887 tried their luck once more in a push for statewide prohibition in Tennessee, which had been growing in dry strength for years. Though the governor vetoed an 1873 law to allow local option elections on prohibition, the Volunteer State a few years later gained the Four Mile Law, perhaps the most advanced temperance legislation in the South. Sewanee, the University of the South, secured in 1877 passage of the Four Mile Law, which banned liquor sales within four miles of a school in an incorporated town. Four years later, the state supreme court ruled that the Four Mile Law could only be enforced around incorporated schools, not in the free schools of some counties. The founding of a state WCTU in 1882 signaled the growth of the dry movement in the state. By 1885, the state WCTU and other drys lobbied the Tennessee legislature to pass a prohibition amendment to the state constitution. The text of the amendment read: \xe2\x80\x9cNo person shall manufacture for sale or keep for sale as a beverage any intoxicating liquors whatever, including wine, ale, and beer. The General Assembly shall by law prescribe regulations for the enforcement of Prohibition herein contained, and shall thereby provide suitable penalties for the violation of the provision thereof.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en76" href="part0020.html#ch02en76e">76</a></span> While a majority of the legislature voted for the amendment, the needed two-thirds majority could not be attained in the senate, and as in North Carolina in 1881, both parties in Tennessee preferred a plebiscite to avoid open division in their ranks. So, on September 29, 1886, an overwhelming majority voted to submit the amendment to a popular vote, which was scheduled to take place exactly a year later, on September 29, 1887.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en77" href="part0020.html#ch02en77e">77</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">As in Georgia and Texas, Tennessee drys also attempted to distance their movement from partisan politics. One paper stated in early September that the prohibition movement \xe2\x80\x9cis not political party measure, and has not connection with any political party,\xe2\x80\x9d despite the attempts of wet papers such as <span class="italic">New Era</span> to brand it as such.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en78" href="part0020.html#ch02en78e">78</a></span> Later that month, the same paper claimed that prohibition sentiment rang throughout the state, endorsed by \xe2\x80\x9cDemocrats and Republicans, black and white\xe2\x80\x9d alike.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en79" href="part0020.html#ch02en79e">79</a></span> Drys claimed then, as they had for years before and decades since, that prohibition would conserve public resources by reducing the crime caused by saloons, which cost taxpayers more through prisons than it gained by liquor licenses. In 1887, drys convinced four hundred convicts in Nashville to claim that three-quarters of the state\xe2\x80\x99s criminals were incarcerated due to alcohol. Newspapers such as the limited-time <span class="italic">Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Appeal</span> and the popular Nashville <span class="italic">Banner</span> supported the dry cause. The Jonesboro WCTU sought to woo voters through music, festive decorations, and \xe2\x80\x9cfree lunches on election day\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a transparent, if effective, effort at low-key bribery in an age before the secret ballot.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en80" href="part0020.html#ch02en80e">80</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Leading up to the vote, tensions rose and occasionally flared into violence. After drys insulted Betsy Ward, a saloon owner who stood fast against a Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Crusade in Greeneville, Tennessee, in 1874, her eighteen-year-old son, William Ward, fought with them, resulting in his death. Despite the drys\xe2\x80\x99 claims that alcohol led to violence and crime, they themselves contributed to the same in the killing of a teenage boy. Wets, for their part, maintained that prohibition would generate more crime by creating an illicit alcohol traffic, harm the economy, reduce public revenue, and undermine the basic principles of democratic liberty.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en81" href="part0020.html#ch02en81e">81</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">The vote was closer in Tennessee than in Texas, but it still resulted in defeat for the drys. The tally had 145,197 wet votes to 117,504 dry, or 55 percent wet.

This charge was the least credible in North Carolina, in which most African Americans followed Republican Party directives and voted wet. Yet even so, the final tally was 77.5 percent wet, so overwhelming that most white voters, Republican and Democratic alike, also likely rejected prohibition. Nevertheless, some white drys implausibly tried to blame African Americans for their loss.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en84" href="part0020.html#ch02en84e">84</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">In Atlanta, on the other hand, it was certainly true that Black votes made up the margin of victory in both directions. As H. Paul Thompson has examined at length, African Americans cast deciding votes to turn the county dry in 1885 as well as to turn it wet in 1887. Black voters who supported prohibition in 1885 because of the opportunity for interracial political cooperation grew disillusioned by the broken promises of whites. At the same time, the white vote also went wet in 1887, meaning both racial groups were equally responsible for the result.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en85" href="part0020.html#ch02en85e">85</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">More ambiguous are the cases of Texas, which voted 63 percent wet, and Tennessee, which went 55 percent wet.

E. B. Du Bois pointed out.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Du Bois, the first African American to earn a PhD from Harvard University, and a self-proclaimed prohibitionist, attested that most white drys immediately scapegoated African Americans for their 1887 defeats. In a seven-page handwritten \xe2\x80\x9cOpen letter to the Southern People\xe2\x80\x9d dated that year, he flipped white drys\xe2\x80\x99 anti-Black narrative and blamed the losses on white folly.

Thus, southern whites\xe2\x80\x99 racist policies \xe2\x80\x9crecoiled upon its strongest advocates.\xe2\x80\x9d Du Bois took the opportunity to echo the Bible and compare Black voters to Jesus: \xe2\x80\x9cThe stone which the builders rejected had of length become the head of the corner.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en89" href="part0020.html#ch02en89e">89</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Another reason for African American hesitation to vote dry, according to Du Bois, was the close association of white-supremacist Democrats with the dry cause.

A careful analysis of his raw data and other census information (<span>see <a class="nounder" href="part0012.html#tab02">table 2</a></span>) suggests that Black voters in 1887 did not behave significantly differently from other voters, since there was no consistent correlation between the Black percentage of a county\xe2\x80\x99s population and the percentage of wet voters in that county.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en96" href="part0020.html#ch02en96e">96</a></span></p>\n<p class="table-title" id="tab02"><b class="calibre2">Table 2.</b> Comparing 1887 Texas Vote to Black Population in Select Counties</p>\n<p class="images"><img src="../images/00006.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre3"/></p>\n<p class="table-source"><span class="italic">Source:</span> Sutton, \xe2\x80\x9cEthnic Minorities,\xe2\x80\x9d 35, 80, 82, 86.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">James Ivy has made the most thorough attempt to provide specific numbers for racial and ethnic groups in the 1887 election, and his numbers on African American voters deserve the most scrutiny.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en97" href="part0020.html#ch02en97e">97</a></span> Ivy tallied the Black vote total at 71,338 while placing their opposition to prohibition at over 83 percent, an even higher rate than in Cantrell\xe2\x80\x99s model, which had 74 percent voting wet. Even so, Ivy has confessed that his model is imperfect. To his great credit, Ivy granted that his model initially inaccurately calculated the foreign-born vote and \xe2\x80\x9cyielded an impossible result\xe2\x80\x9d of 122.3 percent wet, which he adjusted accordingly (to 91.3 percent wet, close to Cantrell\xe2\x80\x99s projection of effectively 100 percent wet). In addition, Ivy\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of the Black vote is suspect because of a sizable computational error elsewhere. His vote total for drys in the 1911 statewide vote inverted two crucial numerals: the actual number was 231,096 for Prohibition, but Ivy inverted the 3 and 1 to make 213,096, a difference of 18,000 votes. While understandable, that computational error nearly quadrupled the margin of victory from the actual 1.3 percent of the total vote to \xe2\x80\x9cover five percent\xe2\x80\x9d in his reckoning.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en98" href="part0020.html#ch02en98e">98</a></span> Given the admitted flaws of Ivy\xe2\x80\x99s model regarding foreign-born voters and his erroneous reporting of the 1911 results, it seems possible that his African American vote projection might also need correction.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">If Ivy\xe2\x80\x99s Black vote projection is adjusted to reflect a contemporary estimate of the Black vote, Black voters were <span class="italic">drier</span> than the population at large. By lowering Ivy\xe2\x80\x99s African American wet vote percentage downward by the same proportion as his adjustment for foreign-born whites (about one-quarter), results come to about 62 percent of African Americans voting wet. That number very nearly fits the 60 percent figure given by the <span class="italic">Star of Zion,</span> an African Methodist Episcopal Zion (AMEZ) newspaper edited by John C. Dancy, just a few weeks after the 1887 election. The AMEZ paper conceded that, out of approximately 80,000 African Americans casting ballots in Texas, 60 percent of them voted wet.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en99" href="part0020.html#ch02en99e">99</a></span> While the dry paper might have overestimated dry support, its contemporary reporting and its willingness to give the wets a clear majority of the Black vote support its veracity. Tweaking that 60 percent number upward to account for bias and too-neat rounding, one arrives at something close to the 62 percent made by adjusting Ivy\xe2\x80\x99s total downward. Given that tweaked percentage, African Americans in 1887 Texas voted comparably to white voters. Contrary to scholarly assumptions that Black voters were wetter than whites, they were, at least in Texas, as dry if not <span class="italic">drier</span> than whites.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">However, even if Ivy\xe2\x80\x99s high-end estimate of Black voters as 83 percent wet (or Cantrell\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of 74 percent wet) is correct, native-born white voters would have defeated prohibition all by themselves without help from racial and ethnic minorities. Ivy argues that native-born whites voted 55 percent wet and provided nearly two-thirds of the overall wet vote, while African Americans provided scarcely a quarter of the wet vote. Ivy\xe2\x80\x99s analysis thus effectively refutes Gregg Cantrell\xe2\x80\x99s deductions that native-born whites were evenly split in 1887; Ivy\xe2\x80\x99s 55\xe2\x80\x9345 is a far cry from Cantrell\xe2\x80\x99s 50\xe2\x80\x9350. And if the adjusted projections of the Black vote as 62 percent wet are correct, then even more than 55 percent of native whites voted wet, making the nonwhite vote even less consequential in the wets\xe2\x80\x99 victory. Despite fears among some whites in both the dry and the wet camps that Black participation in the election might imperil white supremacy, African Americans did not cast decisive votes in Texas in 1887.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en100" href="part0020.html#ch02en100e">100</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Given this context, claims by Du Bois and others that Black voters tipped Tennessee wet later that year must be taken with a grain of salt. According to a Tennessee paper (citing a Republican paper elsewhere), more than two-thirds of whites voted dry while about 92 percent of black voters went wet, so that drys would have won by 40,000 votes were it not for Black voters. However, the paper defended the integrity of African Americans; they were not \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly influenced\xe2\x80\x9d but voted wet because \xe2\x80\x9cthey are not far enough away from the period of slavery to willingly take any risks where a question of individual liberty is in the remotest degree involved.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed, black voters were even <span class="italic">more</span> wary than whites of any movement that might seem to be \xe2\x80\x9cabridging their rights,\xe2\x80\x9d including prohibition. Black voters in Tennessee went wetter than whites, the paper claimed, because their love of liberty was greater.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en101" href="part0020.html#ch02en101e">101</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Despite its charitable interpretation of why most Black voters went wet, this paper\xe2\x80\x99s claim that 92 percent of them opposed prohibition seems a bit high, particularly given the much more mixed African American vote in Texas earlier that year (62 percent wet). While African Americans might have provided the margin of victory in Tennessee, this seems implausible. The failure of Tennessee to produce effective statewide prohibition for several more decades, years after most Black voters had been effectively disfranchised, suggests that most whites had opposed prohibition since the 1880s and continued to do so for decades. A simpler and more plausible explanation is that white and Black votes in Tennessee both voted equally wet, but white drys sought to blame their failure on their Black neighbors\xe2\x80\x94and wet Republicans sought to credit Black voters for their defense of liberty.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Rather than being caused by Black voters, the defeat of southern drys in the 1880s statewide votes was mainly due to white evangelical ministers failing to convince their parishioners. Methodist and Baptist laity were ambivalent about political preaching; the flocks had flogged back their shepherds. This pew-pulpit divide was laid bare in the title of the 1887 Baptist General Convention of Texas (BGCT) temperance report: \xe2\x80\x9cAttitude which Baptists <span class="italic">should</span> Occupy toward the Liquor Traffic\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis mine). That report claimed that Baptists ought to confront the liquor traffic with \xe2\x80\x9cTruceless, uncompromising, eternal war,\xe2\x80\x9d but this was aspirational, not descriptive.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en102" href="part0020.html#ch02en102e">102</a></span> For years after 1887, the committee spilled more ink recording the powers and evils of the alcohol lobby than progress against it.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en103" href="part0020.html#ch02en103e">103</a></span> Perhaps the most devastating admission was in the 1894 report: \xe2\x80\x9cthe attitude Baptists <span class="italic">should</span> occupy\xe2\x80\x9d did not match \xe2\x80\x9cthe attitude Baptists <span class="italic">do</span> occupy on this important subject\xe2\x80\x9d (emphases original). They admitted with sorrow that \xe2\x80\x9cthe attitude of Baptists toward the liquor traffic is one of general apathy.\xe2\x80\x9d Still, the committee affirmed the right of Baptists to dissent: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not competent for this Convention to dictate to any Baptist the attitude he should occupy on any question of conscience, but your committee announces its own position.\xe2\x80\x9d While allowing dissent, the closing prayer urged Baptists to be \xe2\x80\x9cloyal and brave and true,\xe2\x80\x9d implying that wets were disloyal, cowardly, and false.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en104" href="part0020.html#ch02en104e">104</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Decades later, white drys looked back on the 1887 campaigns as a turning point. In 1923, J. M. Carroll recalled the 1887 fight as a military affair which \xe2\x80\x9caffected the life and Christian standing of every denomination, of every church, of every preacher and of every individual within the State of Texas.\xe2\x80\x9d More than affecting all peoples in the state, the campaign proved \xe2\x80\x9ca mighty revealer of men and things,\xe2\x80\x9d not only who were \xe2\x80\x9cthe real men\xe2\x80\x9d and who the \xe2\x80\x9cimitating manikins,\xe2\x80\x9d but also \xe2\x80\x9cit revealed Satan, the one supreme personality back of the whole nefarious business.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en105" href="part0020.html#ch02en105e">105</a></span> Baptist ministers told to stay out of the political issue of prohibition remained convinced that they were merely expressing their right and duty to speak out against evil, and would rather endure privation and slander as real men than fail to resist Satan. However, southern white evangelical churches had more than a few \xe2\x80\x9cimitating manikins\xe2\x80\x9d who felt free to vote wet in 1887.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The perceived satanic threat posed by demon rum remained in 1893, when the BGCT temperance report gave the grimmest picture yet of the power of the liquor traffic. \xe2\x80\x9cNever before in the history of America,\xe2\x80\x9d they declared, \xe2\x80\x9chas there been greater aggression or more compact organization on the part of the liquor sellers than now.\xe2\x80\x9d Particularly in Texas, the \xe2\x80\x9csecret organization among saloon keepers has been perfected and has permeated every nook and corner of our state.\xe2\x80\x9d The evil network \xe2\x80\x9cis to our state what the mafia was to New Orleans and what the nihilists are to Russia\xe2\x80\x9d; its \xe2\x80\x9cemissaries of evil are always at work and exercise more power in the state . . . than all the preachers in Texas.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en106" href="part0020.html#ch02en106e">106</a></span> The next year the committee \xe2\x80\x9cdoubted whether there is in all the world a greater impediment to the spread of the gospel of Jesus than the saloon.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en107" href="part0020.html#ch02en107e">107</a></span> To fail to stand against the traffic \xe2\x80\x9cis like asking our mothers and their little ones to march in to the valley of the shadow of death and to the gate of hell,\xe2\x80\x9d and accordingly the committee recommended \xe2\x80\x9cintolerance toward dram-drinking in our members\xe2\x80\x9d and living out total abstinence as \xe2\x80\x9ca chief aim\xe2\x80\x9d to assert the church\xe2\x80\x99s moral influence.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en108" href="part0020.html#ch02en108e">108</a></span> This shift toward putting their own house in order continued over the next several years, strengthened prohibition sentiment among white Baptists and white Methodists, and laid the foundation of a new generation of prohibitionists who would challenge the alcohol industry more effectively.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en109" href="part0020.html#ch02en109e">109</a></span> Yet in the 1880s, the \xe2\x80\x9cdemon\xe2\x80\x9d of anti-prohibition sat comfortably in their pews.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Conclusion</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">In the South, the close tie between feminism and prohibition initially hurt drys. Women helped stir up the first major surge of interest for prohibition in the 1880s, though most southern white men wanted to keep women out of politics just as much as they wanted to keep out prohibition. As James Ivy argues, the close association of prohibition with socially disruptive \xe2\x80\x9clong-haired men\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cshort-haired women\xe2\x80\x9d contributed to the defeat of prohibition in Texas in 1887, and dry leaders thereafter marginalized the role of women in future prohibition campaigns. Similar results in North Carolina and Tennessee that decade reinforced similar ideas across the region. Joe Coker argues that prohibitionists across the South gained success only because they adapted to uphold traditional gender roles, keeping women on a pedestal but away from the ballot box.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch02en110" href="part0020.html#ch02en110e">110</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">While the 1887 campaigns failed by wide margins, they mobilized the Black vote and demonstrated that African Americans were sought after as a swing vote in elections on alcohol. Unfortunately, many white drys perceived the Black vote as a stumbling block to be overcome and sought to strengthen their position by joining a growing movement to disfranchise nonwhites. The 1880s campaigns thus generated a backlash that would eventually link prohibition in the South inextricably with Jim Crow.</p>\n</body></html>\n'</p>
