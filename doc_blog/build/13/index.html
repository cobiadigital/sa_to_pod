In that era, pastors often denounced the alcohol traffic for spawning crime, economic waste, political corruption, women\xe2\x80\x99s degradation, moral degeneration, and countless ailments. Brewers were, in a word, evil. For decades before and after that 1912 letter, the United States endured a culture war over prohibition\xe2\x80\x94the legal ban on the manufacture, transportation, and sale of alcohol. The drama played out in churches, legislatures, courthouses, alleyways, prisons, and voting booths. Prohibitionist \xe2\x80\x9cdrys\xe2\x80\x9d battled anti-prohibition \xe2\x80\x9cwets,\xe2\x80\x9d legitimized political preaching, and, from January 1920 to December 1933, banned the alcohol traffic throughout the United States. The nation\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful dry organization, the Anti-Saloon League (ASL), was organized by a Congregational minister and used the motto: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Church in Action Against the Saloon.\xe2\x80\x9d God, it seemed, was on the side of the drys.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">But that July 1912 letter told a very different story. For one thing, its author was John B. Rayner, a political organizer who had been the most famous African American in the Populist Party. For another, he did not object to the brewers\xe2\x80\x99 business. Indeed, he had spent much of the past seven years campaigning against prohibition. He just wanted to be paid.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The payment he demanded was not unearned or unreasonable; it was back pay for his invaluable political services over the past seven years that had helped keep the brewers\xe2\x80\x99 business legal. Rayner claimed to have tipped the balance in twenty \xe2\x80\x9clocal option\xe2\x80\x9d contests\xe2\x80\x94votes to ban or legalize alcohol in towns, cities, or counties\xe2\x80\x94and mobilized thousands of Black farmers, whose votes had averted statewide prohibition in 1911. In an earlier letter, he claimed to have mobilized tens of thousands of Black voters. He used \xe2\x80\x9cMachiavellian diplomacy\xe2\x80\x9d in African American \xe2\x80\x9creligious, educational and business gatherings,\xe2\x80\x9d employing know-how from his days as a Populist Party boss. In short, he was a \xe2\x80\x9cprotagonist\xe2\x80\x9d against prohibition who did more for anti-prohibition \xe2\x80\x9cthan all the other [African Americans] combined.\xe2\x80\x9d Rayner claimed not to have profited personally from this but rather sold or mortgaged his best properties for the cause, while brewers prospered.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en1" href="part0020.html#ch00en1e">1</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">What would compel a Christian minister to endure such suffering for an industry so disreputable that most Protestant churches advocated its abolition? Rayner claimed that he did it because \xe2\x80\x9cthe liberty of man is in danger.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en2" href="part0020.html#ch00en2e">2</a></span> For many believers, then as now, Christian liberty meant more than abstract forgiveness of sins and hope for the hereafter; it meant freedom in the here and now. Christian wets used the language of Christian liberty to preach against prohibition, and this took on a special significance in the Black church. At that time, African Americans were losing civil liberties far more pressing than the freedom to drink. Under Jim Crow, millions of Black Americans across the South lost their right to vote. Restrictive voting laws such as poll taxes had virtually eliminated African American influence over statewide elected office in the region by 1902. Nonetheless, many Black citizens across the South could still vote\xe2\x80\x94if they could afford poll taxes. African Americans whose faith compelled them to vote found supporters in the alcohol lobby: a wealthy, white-owned industry willing to do anything to secure votes. It seemed a match made in heaven.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">This is not just a story of John Rayner or of African American Christians working with brewers. It is not even just a history of anti-prohibition in the South. Rather, this book offers a religious and racial history of prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s rise and fall in the US South from 1885 to 1935. Race (particularly white and Black) and religion (particularly Christianity) are two areas in which prohibition wrought profound changes to the cultural landscape of the South and the whole nation. While some aspects of the connections between prohibition, race, and religion have received scholarly attention, other aspects have remained understudied. The book gives as much distinct emphasis to prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s relationship to Christianity as to its relationship to race, and it focuses as much on the anti-prohibition movement as on prohibitionists.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Approach and Sources</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">While the book moves between emphases on race and religion for the sake of analytical clarity, it sees the two as parts of a seamless cultural whole. As Kristin Kobes Du Mez argues in <span class="italic">Jesus and John Wayne,</span> a supposedly theological category such as \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98conservative evangelical\xe2\x80\x99 is as much about culture as it is about theology\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and the culture she focuses on concerns constructions of gender, politics, and race.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en3" href="part0020.html#ch00en3e">3</a></span> While Du Mez\xe2\x80\x99s book focuses on white evangelicals since 1945, her statement also resonates with \xe2\x80\x9clived religion\xe2\x80\x9d approaches to ethno-religious communities from New England Puritans to present-day charismatics.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en4" href="part0020.html#ch00en4e">4</a></span> Viewing prohibition through the twin lenses of race and religion enables in-depth attention to how stray strands of theology and minority figures ordinarily overlooked in prohibition studies might cast the overall picture in a new light.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">This study arrives at these findings by heeding quieter or unheard voices and by noting absences of language just as much as their presence. African American and more traditionalist churches have received less attention on prohibition (and other culture-war issues) than white evangelicals, yet some searching reveals that the former groups played major roles in the contest. Though most wets did not scream their religious credentials as loudly as most drys did, close analysis of theological and ritual details reveals convictions that informed the wet stance of millions of southern voters. Indeed, the toning down of religious and racial rhetoric in the 1930s was itself a major development in the prohibition debate, signaling a significant break from past activism. Approaching religious practice as always potentially interacting with politics and cultural issues such as race, even when religious rhetoric is not obviously linked to activism, helps uncover the subtle\xe2\x80\x94and therefore understudied\xe2\x80\x94connections between faith and politics.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en5" href="part0020.html#ch00en5e">5</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">This study employs a wide array of primary sources, including election data, secular and religious newspapers, denominational minutes, speeches, correspondence, and contemporary publications. Archives from Texas to Tennessee and abundant digitized sources were invaluable for this research. It is unfortunate that, even in the best archives, African American denominational sources are generally less complete than comparable white sources, but enough sources have survived to give a decent impression of the debates over prohibition in Black churches. Speeches from white evangelical wets and surviving correspondence from brewers (thanks to the vigorous investigations of Texas\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general, B. F. Looney) provided priceless insights as well. This book\xe2\x80\x99s main contribution, however, is not so much uncovering new sources as viewing widely available evidence through the twin lenses of religion and race. In both areas, prohibition and anti-prohibition reshaped the order of southern society and politics.</p>\n<p class="x-a">(Anti-)Prohibition and Race</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Viewing prohibition through the lens of race clarifies larger political trends in the South, particularly around the term \xe2\x80\x9cGin Crow.\xe2\x80\x9d Gin Crow is peculiar phrase which, as far as this author knows, is unique to this book, and it asserts that prohibition in the US South was closely linked to Jim Crow, an array of measures that aimed to secure white supremacy through racial segregation and the suppression of Black votes. The links between prohibition and Jim Crow that constitute Gin Crow can be divided into four broad categories: chronology, white dry support, Black resistance, and racial enforcement. First, chronologically, statewide prohibition existed in the South only during Jim Crow (except in Mississippi, which remained nominally dry into the 1960s).</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Second, white drys transitioned their tactics from openly seeking interracial coalitions in the 1880s to seeking victory through suppressing Black votes and converting white votes. White drys believed it was the only reliable path to prohibition in the region. As Ann-Marie Szymanski observed, \xe2\x80\x9cdisfranchisement of blacks principally enhanced the opportunities for dry success by eliminating one of the leading rationales for Democratic unity in the South\xe2\x80\x9d: namely, white-only control of political power.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en6" href="part0020.html#ch00en6e">6</a></span> Howard Rabinowitz and Richard Hamm likewise contend that African Americans\xe2\x80\x99 tendency to vote against prohibition, especially in close elections, was a major argument for their disfranchisement, which in turn helped prohibition succeed in the South.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en7" href="part0020.html#ch00en7e">7</a></span> Some of the most prominent drys in the South\xe2\x80\x94including \xe2\x80\x9cFather of American Prohibition\xe2\x80\x9d Richmond Pearson Hobson, prohibition \xe2\x80\x9cmartyr\xe2\x80\x9d Edward Ward Carmack, Methodist Bishop James Cannon, and Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard Hiram Wesley Evans\xe2\x80\x94were also notorious white supremacists who deployed racist rhetoric to advance their dry cause. In short, white drys supported Jim Crow, which in turn enabled prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s success.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Discussions of race, religion, and alcohol in the South cannot be separated from discussions of gender. As Joe Coker argues, racial hierarchy, honor, and gender roles were essential components in prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s rise in the South.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en8" href="part0020.html#ch00en8e">8</a></span> One obvious example of those three value sets coming together for prohibition was the specter of a drunken Black man attacking a white woman. This racist trope, the worn excuse for lynchings and all manner of white-supremacist violence, was also a piece of white dry propaganda in the South. If alcohol in the hands of Black men symbolized a vital threat to the racial and gendered order, then abolishing that threat by law became an imperative. In fact, some drys urged prohibition so that lynchings could be avoided: without demon rum, docility would replace danger, and all would be well. The exaggerated fear of disorderly Black men assaulting white women loomed large in the imagination of honor-bound white southerners and played no small role in prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s rise in the region. By their rhetoric and actions, prominent white drys advanced and upheld the racial hierarchy of Jim Crow.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Third, due to this dynamic, African American participation in local and statewide prohibition elections in the 1900s and 1910s effectively became a form of resistance to Jim Crow. Though Jim Crow laws depressed Black voter turnout immediately, thousands of African Americans continued to decide prohibition elections at the local and state levels into the 1910s in defiance of laws that attempted to erase their political influence. Admittedly, Black resistance to Gin Crow was circumscribed. Jim Crow laws had disfranchised most\xe2\x80\x94though not all\xe2\x80\x94African Americans by the first decade of the twentieth century, and white Democrats exercised a stranglehold on statewide offices and state legislatures throughout the region. African American voters responded by overwhelmingly backing the brewers, who were desperate enough to do anything, even undermining Jim Crow, to stay in business. White supremacists in the wet coalition unwittingly helped to prop up interracial politics by protecting the alcohol lobby, which was the most powerful white industry to mobilize Black voters and to subvert Jim Crow poll taxes. To oppose Gin Crow (southern prohibition) in the 1910s was to oppose Jim Crow, and that opposition was stronger and went longer than scholars have previously thought possible.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en9" href="part0020.html#ch00en9e">9</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Scholars have not realized how much Black votes mattered in prohibition contests in the 1910s. African Americans decided countless local option elections and even several statewide elections across the South as late as 1910 (Florida), 1911 (Texas), and 1912 (Arkansas). Sociologist Ann-Marie Szymanski claims that African Americans\xe2\x80\x99 impact on prohibition elections in the South is difficult to verify, since drys lost those statewide referenda \xe2\x80\x9cdespite the diminished voting power of southern blacks.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en10" href="part0020.html#ch00en10e">10</a></span> However, that same evidence could also suggest that wets won in those states precisely because African Americans continued to vote despite restrictive voting laws. Wets won those election precisely because of Black voters, not despite their absence.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Perhaps scholars have overlooked African American voters of the 1910s because prohibition had so thoroughly devastated Black voting by 1920. Just as disfranchising Black voters helped dry up the South, so also the imposition of prohibition, by removing the political protection of the alcohol lobby, finally silenced mass Black voting across the South. Statewide prohibition across the South in the mid-to-late 1910s accomplished what Jim Crow laws on their own failed to do: end meaningful and mass voting for Black southerners.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Fourth, during prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s regime, racial minorities were disproportionately arrested and punished for violations of drug laws. White drys were concerned not only with containing Black votes but also with controlling Black bodies. Aaron Griffith has observed that, \xe2\x80\x9cThroughout the nation\xe2\x80\x99s history, race has been a crucial backdrop for American thinking and policymaking on criminal justice,\xe2\x80\x9d and this is no less true on prohibition enforcement.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en11" href="part0020.html#ch00en11e">11</a></span> As Michelle Alexander has demonstrated, mass incarceration has been and continues to be one of the major drivers of systemic racial inequality. Lisa McGirr likewise argues that, just as racial minorities face higher arrest rates, higher conviction rates, and more time served than whites in the latter-day War on Drugs, so it was a century ago in the War on Alcohol. Then as now, unequal enforcement of drug laws provided a useful tool for whites to control Black souls. If opposition to the War on Drugs today constitutes opposition to the \xe2\x80\x9cNew Jim Crow,\xe2\x80\x9d opposition to prohibition then constituted opposition to the old Jim Crow.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en12" href="part0020.html#ch00en12e">12</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">In short, prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s timing, implementation, resistance, and enforcement made it an integral part of Jim Crow, such that those who resisted prohibition in the South were effectively defying Gin Crow, whether or not they did so intentionally. Even when white wet Christians did not explicitly oppose Jim Crow, their anti-prohibition activism in the 1900s and 1910s effectively prolonged African American suffrage and thus delayed complete racial disfranchisement in the region.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The racial story of Gin Crow does not stop in 1920, however, but continued until its repeal in the 1930s. As Barry Hankins correctly notes, African Americans \xe2\x80\x9cplayed almost no part\xe2\x80\x9d in prohibition contests in the 1920s because they \xe2\x80\x9cwere not allowed to participate\xe2\x80\x9d in what had become a \xe2\x80\x9cwhite culture war.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en13" href="part0020.html#ch00en13e">13</a></span> However, white drys continued to invoke racial fears against the wet presidential candidate in 1928, once again linking Gin Crow to white supremacism. Then in 1932, white southerners worried less about the Democratic presidential nominee\xe2\x80\x99s wet stance than white unity, especially after the Republican White House had transgressed white southern racial and gender lines by treating an African American congressman\xe2\x80\x99s wife as an equal to white women. The relative absence of racial language during the repeal debates of the 1930s compared with the prohibition debates of the 1910s demonstrates how much prohibition had affected and been affected by racial politics in the South over just a few years.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The rise of white women in southern politics from the 1910s to the 1930s corresponded to the political decline of African Americans. The language of cleaning up politics though prohibition and (white) women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage together took on explicitly racial dimensions in the South. Particularly after drys suffered narrow losses in statewide elections across the South in the 1910s, white drys increasingly complained that Black (and in Texas, Mexican) men could vote against prohibition while white women could not vote for it. The wet coalition in the 1930s South had virtually no African Americans, but it grew to include prominent white women, including state legislators and a governor. The move of respectable white women into wet ranks signaled another shift: women\xe2\x80\x99s support gave wets the moral high ground previously held by drys, in part because white women did not feel they needed prohibition anymore to protect them from Black men. While Jim Crow remained for decades more, Gin Crow died in part because it was no longer needed to maintain the racial order.</p>\n<p class="x-a">(Anti-)Prohibition and Christianity</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Prohibition also reshaped southern Christianity in four major ways. First, before dry agitation gained supremacy in the early twentieth century, most southerners stood with millennia of Christian tradition, which had blessed moderate consumption of fermented drinks at home and in the sacred act of communion. Many Christian southerners loudly objected to prohibition as an alien innovation in theology and polity. To justify their political reform, drys first reshaped communion, denominations, and Bible interpretation to fit with their common-sense objections to alcohol, then deployed a combination of righteous indignation, racial invective, and modern organization to implement their political vision. Many scholars have noted that prohibition was politically progressive, but few have observed how deeply it transgressed the theological orthodoxies of the South.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en14" href="part0020.html#ch00en14e">14</a></span> The political revolution of prohibition was necessarily preceded by a religious one.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Second, religion played a major role on both sides in the culture war before prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s zenith, and this book pays particular attention to the neglected role of Christian rhetoric for wets. Joseph Locke and other scholars have noted how drys mainstreamed political preaching in the South and so created the Bible Belt, but none have paid comparable attention to how wets also deployed boldly religious rhetoric.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en15" href="part0020.html#ch00en15e">15</a></span> The contest over prohibition in the South included multiple Christian identities and theologies competing for social dominance. Christian wets ranged from Episcopalian bishops and Catholic priests to Black Baptist ministers and lay white Southern Methodists. Some wets claimed that prohibition was irreconcilable with traditional Christian teachings on morality, liberty, moderate alcohol use, and communion wine. Before drys could argue against alcohol in general, they had to abolish ritual communion wine in their churches, demonstrating how their political views led them to dispense with or modernize ancient Christian rites. Even some white evangelicals, usually lay politicians, objected to prohibition on carefully reasoned Christian tradition and the Bible, revealing a divide between pulpit and pew even in supposedly bone-dry denominations. The South\xe2\x80\x99s religious-political scene, at least before 1920, was rich in complexity. A South that largely condemned dry ministers\xe2\x80\x99 political preaching in the 1880s had by the 1920s embraced it, and prohibition had opened the door to Christianity playing explicitly on <span class="italic">both</span> sides of culture wars. As some drys wryly noted, wets may have objected to political preaching when drys did it, but they did not mind political preaching when it was on <span class="italic">their</span> side.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en16" href="part0020.html#ch00en16e">16</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Third, the prohibition movement in the South started off as somewhat religiously ecumenical but ended up fueling anti-Catholic bigotry. While some northern Republicans labeled Democrats the party of \xe2\x80\x9crum, Romanism, and rebellion\xe2\x80\x9d in 1884, southern drys from the 1880s to the 1910s attempted to win over Catholics, and a few prominent Catholics such as Archbishop John Ireland supported prohibition. When prohibition became the law in the late 1910s, however, the religious calculus shifted. The only US governor ever elected under the Prohibition Party banner, Sidney Johnston Catts of Florida, rode into office in 1917 on a wave of anti-Catholic bigotry. The second iteration of the Ku Klux Klan embodied racial and religious prejudice in the 1910s and 1920s, and as Lisa McGirr has noted, prohibition \xe2\x80\x9cenabled the Klan\xe2\x80\x99s rise to power.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en17" href="part0020.html#ch00en17e">17</a></span> The presidential election of 1928 raised anti-Catholicism to a fever pitch as the Democratic nominee, Al Smith, was a wet Catholic. Prominent southern Protestants from the progressive Southern Methodist James Cannon in Virginia to the Fundamentalist Baptist J. Frank Norris in Texas led an insurrection against the Democratic Party\xe2\x80\x99s nominee and shattered the \xe2\x80\x9cSolid South\xe2\x80\x9d with a seamless blend of dry and anti-Catholic rhetoric.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Fourth, the effort to repeal prohibition in the South in the 1930s signaled a retreat from the vigorous political preaching of the 1910s and 1920s toward more secular rhetoric. Just as racial language cooled from the election of 1928, so also did stridently religious language, or at least such language was mostly on the losing side. The election of 1928 had bitterly divided the South\xe2\x80\x99s solidly Democratic white electorate with political preaching, yet the elections of 1930 and 1932 reunified white Protestant Democrats and punished politicians who had strayed from the party fold. The Democratic presidential nominee in 1932 was another wet New Yorker, but this time he was safely Protestant. Unity around this Protestant candidate ironically weakened the sway of white Baptist and Methodist political preachers who insisted that prohibition was the single issue to unite all Christian voters.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Preachers may have lost political sway in the Great Depression as many sought salvation through the ecumenical New Deal, but women\xe2\x80\x99s political clout had never been stronger. Many southern women led the charge for repeal with less distinctively Christian rhetoric than the Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). While prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s marginalization of nonwhites in the South persisted for decades after repeal, some non-Protestants, particularly white Catholics, politically rose in the region after the nadir of 1928, with some Catholic women serving prominent roles in repeal organizations.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Some scholars have interpreted the repeal of prohibition as the death knell for white Protestant cultural ascendency in the United States, yet in the South it was more of a tactical retreat that foreshadowed a later return.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en18" href="part0020.html#ch00en18e">18</a></span> By pushing the religious narrative past the usual cutoff date of 1920, when prohibition seemed victorious, this trend becomes clear. While political preaching by clergy and laity alike would rise again in the South, ranging from anti\xe2\x80\x93New Deal conservative evangelicals to African Americans in the civil rights movement, its moment would have to wait.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en19" href="part0020.html#ch00en19e">19</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-a">Organization</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">The book proceeds more or less chronologically. Each chapter touches on both race and religion, though some focus more on one or the other. Part I, \xe2\x80\x9cBourbon Rule,\xe2\x80\x9d considers the difficulty of prohibition taking root in the South in the nineteenth century. Most southerners, white and Black alike, embraced a moderate stance on alcohol based on traditional Christian theology and practice, from interpretations of Bible passages to communion wine, so drys were fighting against the cultural and religious current. Chapter 2 explores the interracial politics of prohibition campaigns of the 1880s in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and Texas. While white fears and Black doubts undermined attempts at multiracial dry coalitions, the fact that such attempts occurred at all demonstrates the fluidity of race relations in the pre\xe2\x80\x93Jim Crow period.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Part 2, \xe2\x80\x9cGin Crow,\xe2\x80\x9d considers the rise and fall of statewide and federal prohibition in the region in light of race and religion. Southern white backlash to the apparent failure of interracial politics in the 1880s\xe2\x80\x94along with reaction to the multiracial populist movement\xe2\x80\x94led white drys to favor Jim Crow laws and suppress Black votes. Prohibition in the South, which had once been associated with multiracial coalitions, became intertwined with white-supremacist laws and law enforcement.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Yet many Black and white Christians resisted this new dry order in the 1900s and 1910s. Clergy and laity alike deployed traditional Christian arguments about temperance, the Bible, and liberty against prohibition. African Americans, using networks that included Black churches, allied with brewers to speak out, organize, and cast decisive votes against local option and statewide prohibition referenda from one end of the South to the other. After prohibition triumphed on the state and national levels, enforcement of prohibition disproportionately targeted racial and ethnic minorities, legitimated political preaching by white culture warriors, and emboldened white-supremacist and anti-Catholic politics from the second Ku Klux Klan to the anti\xe2\x80\x93Al Smith movement in 1928.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The final chapter details how the repeal of prohibition in the South was \xe2\x80\x9clily-white\xe2\x80\x9d: white women played decisive roles in repeal, but African Americans were not empowered by the demise of Gin Crow in the 1930s as they had been by resistance to its rise in the 1910s. Also, the repeal effort appealed far less explicitly to race or religion than either wets or drys had in the days before statewide and federal prohibition, indicating broader ebbs and flows in the region\xe2\x80\x99s relationship between race, religion, and politics. A brief epilogue sketches subsequent development in alcohol regulation, religiously infused politics, and the re-empowerment of racial and religious minorities across the South.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Terms</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">More clarification of terms is in order. Prohibition is distinct from yet produced by the temperance movement founded in the 1820s. Some temperance advocates avoided only distilled drinks and used lighter fermented drinks, while others believed only capital-T Total abstinence from alcohol (teetotalism) would do. Another divide formed between those who focused on moral suasion and those who promoted legal bans on alcohol (prohibition). Though prohibitionists often conflated their cause with \xe2\x80\x9ctemperance,\xe2\x80\x9d others also clung to that title. Some historians use capitalized \xe2\x80\x9cProhibition\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to federal prohibition through the Eighteenth Amendment, enforced from 1920 to 1933. Since state and local prohibition laws existed long before and\xe2\x80\x94especially in the South\xe2\x80\x94long after federal prohibition, this book prefers lowercase \xe2\x80\x9cprohibition,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning any law at the local, state, or federal level forbidding the sale of all alcoholic beverages with few exceptions (such as medical and sacramental purposes).</p>\n<p class="x-txt">A related issue is how to label those for and against prohibition. From the nineteenth century to the 1910s, anti-prohibitionists were often called \xe2\x80\x9cantis\xe2\x80\x9d and prohibitionists \xe2\x80\x9cprohis,\xe2\x80\x9d though by the 1920s they were usually labeled \xe2\x80\x9cdry\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwet.\xe2\x80\x9d This text will prefer the simpler and more natural language of \xe2\x80\x9cdry\xe2\x80\x9d for prohibitionists and \xe2\x80\x9cwet\xe2\x80\x9d for anti-prohibitionists, while acknowledging its anachronistic nature for earlier chapters.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Like \xe2\x80\x9cprohibition,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe South\xe2\x80\x9d is a fuzzy term with multiple possible definitions.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en20" href="part0020.html#ch00en20e">20</a></span> This book chiefly uses \xe2\x80\x9cthe South\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to the eleven formerly Confederate states: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. There are several reasons for this. First, this narrative mostly takes place after the Civil War and Reconstruction, which forged a distinctive southern history and identity. However, when briefly referencing the antebellum period, a broader definition of the South is used, including slave states such as Kentucky and Maryland.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Also, the former Confederacy shares a distinctive regional arc for prohibition. After resisting statewide dry laws longer than any other region in the country, statewide prohibition persisted there longer than the rest of the nation. While a few northern states went dry before or in the decades following the Civil War, no formerly Confederate state went dry until Georgia in 1908. Yet by 1918, every formerly Confederate state except Louisiana had banned alcohol on the state level.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en21" href="part0020.html#ch00en21e">21</a></span> Having gone dry, the South was more reluctant to get wet again than other regions. When national prohibition was repealed by December 1933, statewide prohibition was still on the books for most southern states for several more years.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch00en22" href="part0020.html#ch00en22e">22</a></span> Mississippi did not end statewide prohibition until the 1960s, decades longer than any other state. Even today, a few locales are still dry in the South. Blue laws limiting any sale of alcohol at certain times persist from Texas to the Carolinas.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Another reason to define the South as the former Confederacy is demographic: this book highlights African Americans, so it makes sense to focus on the states where most of them lived prior to and during the Great Migration. This reality prompts further explanation of racial terms.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Regarding race, this book follows an emerging trend among reporters and scholars to use capitalized \xe2\x80\x9cBlack\xe2\x80\x9d rather than lowercase \xe2\x80\x9cblack\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to Americans of African descent, while continuing the convention of using lowercase \xe2\x80\x9cwhite\xe2\x80\x9d for Americans of primarily European descent. Several such vocabular transitions have occurred in the past century, as a survey of scholarly titles over time quickly reveals. \xe2\x80\x9cNegro\xe2\x80\x9d was a common term until the 1970s, when changing norms replaced the term with \xe2\x80\x9cblack\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAfrican American.\xe2\x80\x9d As the latter terms still have widespread currency, this text uses \xe2\x80\x9cBlack\xe2\x80\x9d (as an adjective) interchangeably with \xe2\x80\x9cAfrican American\xe2\x80\x9d in the US context. Following similar scholarly developments, the text uses \xe2\x80\x9cAmerindian\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to indigenous Americans but retains the traditional \xe2\x80\x9cLatino\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to people of Latin American descent (because that follows standard usage in contemporary Spanish, whereas the now-fashionable \xe2\x80\x9cLatinx\xe2\x80\x9d is unpronounceable in Spanish). For all such terms, the author acknowledges that their usage is debated and may well become outdated soon. When quoting others, older spellings and usages are preserved.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">To appreciate the extent to which prohibition brought seismic shifts to race and religion in the South, one first must go back to the days of Bourbon rule, when most southerners, Black and white alike, regarded alcohol as a gift of God.</p>\n</body></html>\n'</p>
