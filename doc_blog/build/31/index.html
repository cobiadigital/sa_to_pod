In 1894, Sidney Johnson Catts, a dry Southern Baptist minister in Alabama (and later governor of Florida), stated: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no question that rum and Romanism go together,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe very stronghold of rum in this country is Romanism.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en2" href="part0020.html#ch05en2e">2</a></span> By 1926, J. Frank Norris, the pastor of First Baptist Church of Fort Worth, was denouncing the presumptive Democratic nominee for president in an article aptly titled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Conspiracy of Rum and Romanism to Rule This Government.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en3" href="part0020.html#ch05en3e">3</a></span> Two years later, many southerners had not only banned rum long since and denounced Romanism in the present, but apparently repented of rebellion as well: Florida, North Carolina, and Virginia voted for a Republican president for the first time (and Tennessee the second time) since Reconstruction, while Norris\xe2\x80\x99s home state of Texas voted for a Republican president for the first time ever. What happened?</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Southern Democrats were more tolerant of Roman Catholics before prohibition became law. Outside Louisiana, Democratic Protestants enjoyed overwhelming voting majorities throughout the South, so Catholics posed little electoral threat to their rule. Southerners in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries had more often accused prohibitionist Protestant clergy, not Roman Catholic politicians, of mixing church and state. Yet when prohibition took effect, Catholic wets found themselves on the wrong side of the law. Anti-Catholicism and prohibition dovetailed in the \xe2\x80\x9claw and order\xe2\x80\x9d rhetoric of politicians like Florida\xe2\x80\x99s firebrand governor, Sidney Johnson Catts. In addition to official censure, Southern Catholics\xe2\x80\x94along with Jews, African Americans, and other minorities\xe2\x80\x94faced persecution from a reborn Ku Klux Klan in the late 1910s and early 1920s. Finally, anti-Catholic rhetoric from drys reached a crescendo in 1928, when the Democratic presidential nominee was a wet, Catholic, Irish German New Yorker named Al Smith. For many Southern Democrats, Smith was too much to bear; they shattered the Solid South by voting for Republican Herbert Hoover, who was reliably dry and Protestant.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Anti-Catholicism and Prohibition</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Scholars have debated how anti-Catholic the prohibition movement was. Most scholars have contended that prohibition generally set white Protestant drys against wet Catholics, Jews, African Americans, recent immigrants, and other racial and religious minorities. Jeanette Miller Schmidt went so far as to suggest that \xe2\x80\x9cthe repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1933 was symbolic of the end of rural Protestantism\xe2\x80\x99s dominance in the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d while Mark A. Noll described prohibition as \xe2\x80\x9cthe last gasp of Protestant hegemony\xe2\x80\x9d in the nation.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en4" href="part0020.html#ch05en4e">4</a></span> While Catholics tended to be wet, some Catholics embraced prohibition. Sometimes dry Protestants explicitly courted Catholic support, as when the dry leader in Texas\xe2\x80\x99s 1887 campaign, B. H. Carroll, shunned overt criticisms of any religious group, including Catholics, who formed about 18 percent of the state population.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en5" href="part0020.html#ch05en5e">5</a></span> While Carroll\xe2\x80\x99s attempts at garnering Catholic support were ineffective, at other times Catholics could and did support the dry cause.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en6" href="part0020.html#ch05en6e">6</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-a">The Prohibition Party Governor: Sidney Johnston Catts</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Prohibition activism and anti-Catholic prejudice together in the South took clear form in Sidney Johnston Catts, who was elected governor of Florida in 1916 as the Prohibition Party candidate, the only candidate of that party ever to win statewide office. Born into a prosperous Alabama family in 1863, he became a Baptist minister after a \xe2\x80\x9cborn again\xe2\x80\x9d experience in 1886. Growing dissatisfied with parish life, Catts ran for Congress in a crowded 1904 special election, but he came in second to another demagogue, James Thomas \xe2\x80\x9cCotton Tom\xe2\x80\x9d Heflin.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en7" href="part0020.html#ch05en7e">7</a></span> Sensing riper political opportunities in neighboring Florida, Catts moved in 1911 to DeFuniak Springs, a city in the Panhandle with a similar racial composition and political orientation as the Alabama Black Belt where Catts grew up. He pastored the First Baptist Church until 1914, when he resigned due to a dispute with the congregation and became a traveling insurance salesman.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en8" href="part0020.html#ch05en8e">8</a></span> Like Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s Jim Folsom and Louisiana\xe2\x80\x99s Huey Long, Catts used his insurance job to prepare for political ascension. In October 1914, he announced the beginning of his campaign for governor of Florida\xe2\x80\x94two years before the 1916 election. His campaign events resembled revival services\xe2\x80\x94including a passing of the offering plate.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en9" href="part0020.html#ch05en9e">9</a></span> Catts combined an open appeal to the \xe2\x80\x9ccracker\xe2\x80\x9d vote with new technologies, roaming the countryside in a Model T equipped with a loudspeaker system to attract crowds of neglected voters. In the words of renowned southern historian Wayne Flynt, Catts \xe2\x80\x9cprovided a voice for the inarticulate \xe2\x80\x98unwashed\xe2\x80\x99 against the carefully manicured and properly pedigreed.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en10" href="part0020.html#ch05en10e">10</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Catt\xe2\x80\x99s populistic style came out clearly on a campaign flier that combined anti-Catholicism, prohibition, and the Lost Cause. The flier, designed for distribution before all his campaign rallies during the Democratic primary, framed his campaign against rum and Romanism, prominently calling him \xe2\x80\x9cThe Catt\xe2\x80\x9d whom \xe2\x80\x9cThe Catholics and The Whiskey Men Are Fighting.\xe2\x80\x9d His eight-point platform spent the most time on the point about opposing Roman Catholicism, the \xe2\x80\x9cgreat menace to the peace of home, the maintenance of our public schools, and the enjoyment of quiet religion.\xe2\x80\x9d The flier appealed to every voter \xe2\x80\x9cwho loves his country and hates Catholic control of American politics, to vote for Catts.\xe2\x80\x9d The shortest point in the platform paired with the anti-Catholicism: \xe2\x80\x9cIn Favor of Prohibition.\xe2\x80\x9d In line with his dry stance, Catts proclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless our women and our homes\xe2\x80\x9d as he appealed to the \xe2\x80\x9cgreat and silent power\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cwives, mothers and sisters . . . who cannot vote\xe2\x80\x9d but still \xe2\x80\x9chelp Catts out in his heroic race.\xe2\x80\x9d He praised white women\xe2\x80\x94but did not declare support for their suffrage. Catts also aligned himself with the Lost Cause. While he never fought in the war (he was born in 1863), he claimed the rank of major as chaplain for the First Florida Brigade of the United Confederate Veterans (UCV) and promised better pensions for veterans.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en11" href="part0020.html#ch05en11e">11</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Catts also used shameless gimmicks to appeal to the common man against the political establishment. Not shy about self-promotion, he compared his oratory with the \xe2\x80\x9cfury\xe2\x80\x9d of fire-eater William Lowndes Yancey and the \xe2\x80\x9celoquence\xe2\x80\x9d of Henry Ward Beecher. Playing off his name, he produced one flier (reproduced in this volume) featuring a large picture of a hissing cat, a catchy jingle (\xe2\x80\x9cKill the Rats\xe2\x80\x94Pay Your Poll Tax and <span class="small-caps2">VOTE</span> for <span class="small-caps2">CATTS</span>\xe2\x80\x9d), and cheesy animal jokes (\xe2\x80\x9cIf Texas had a Hogg for Governor why can\xe2\x80\x99t Florida have a Catt for Governor?\xe2\x80\x9d). The imagery of the tooth-and-claw-bearing cat and \xe2\x80\x9cKill the Rats\xe2\x80\x9d line underscored his sense of embattlement, which was further emphasized in his overt mistrust of the political establishment. The flier stated that, in at least four counties, votes for him might not be counted \xe2\x80\x9cat the poles [<span class="italic">sic</span>],\xe2\x80\x9d and so demanded in giant, all-caps script, \xe2\x80\x9c<span class="small-caps2">CATTS MEN MUST HAVE ONE MAN</span>\xe2\x80\x9d as a watcher at every polling station. To hammer home the point, the flier added: \xe2\x80\x9c<span class="small-caps2">THIS IS NECESSARY, DO IT SURE</span>.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en12" href="part0020.html#ch05en12e">12</a></span> The flier celebrated in giant letters \xe2\x80\x9c<span class="small-caps2">COMMON PEOPLE</span>\xe2\x80\x9d and repeatedly urged them to register and pay their poll tax, showing how Catts exploited neglected voters\xe2\x80\x99 mistrust of political elites.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The mistrust between Catts and the elites was mutual. The <span class="italic">Pensacola Journal</span> cautioned its readers in January 1916 that Catts was a \xe2\x80\x9cdangerous\xe2\x80\x9d man who espoused \xe2\x80\x9crevolutionary\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9canarchistic\xe2\x80\x9d ideas and would bring \xe2\x80\x9ccalamity\xe2\x80\x9d to Florida. The article compared Catts unfavorably with South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s erratic and particularly racist governor from 1911 to 1915, Cole Livingston Blease. While Blease merely disrupted the political peace, Catts threatened to disrupt the religious peace as well. His anti-Catholicism appealed to many of the state\xe2\x80\x99s forty thousand Baptists, whose hostility to Catholics (according to the paper) exceeded any other denomination. He also relied upon a growing anti-Catholic secret society whose numbers may have exceeded ten thousand. Worst of all, Catts was preparing \xe2\x80\x9cto make open war upon the Democratic Party and its candidates\xe2\x80\x9d who were \xe2\x80\x9csuspected of being under Catholic influence,\xe2\x80\x9d which should alarm the \xe2\x80\x9cmost patriotic thinkers.\xe2\x80\x9d The paper also noted that Catts\xe2\x80\x99s main competition in the governor\xe2\x80\x99s race, state treasurer William Valentine Knott, was a devoted Baptist \xe2\x80\x9cof the highest character.\xe2\x80\x9d Anticipating countercharges, the newspaper maintained that all the people working there were Protestants\xe2\x80\x94never Catholic. Even while railing against Catts\xe2\x80\x99s anti-Catholic demagoguery, they admitted the power of that prejudice most eloquently by declaring their Protestant bona fides.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en13" href="part0020.html#ch05en13e">13</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Though he claimed back in 1914, \xe2\x80\x9cI am a Democrat always,\xe2\x80\x9d Catts controversially lost the Democratic primary to Knott in 1916.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en14" href="part0020.html#ch05en14e">14</a></span> Catts led in the initial count, losing only after the Florida Supreme Court order a recount, which Knott narrowly won. Blaming (credibly) corrupt party elites for his loss, Catts campaigned as the true Democratic nominee, but also accepted the Prohibition Party nomination for the general election. His grassroots campaign explicitly courted the poor white rural \xe2\x80\x9ccracker\xe2\x80\x9d vote. As one of his slogans went, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Florida crackers have only three friends: God Almighty, Sears Roebuck, and Sidney J. Catts!\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en15" href="part0020.html#ch05en15e">15</a></span> Southern historian Wayne Flint described the \xe2\x80\x9calmost psychotic anti-Catholicism\xe2\x80\x9d and expletive-laden rants in his campaign speeches, which alienated some audiences but stirred up support from the common people. On election day, Catts emerged with a strong plurality and nearly ten thousand votes more than Knott.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Catt\xe2\x80\x99s inauguration speech in 1917 affirmed the populist bent that would carry him through his four-year term. He invoked Scripture and epic history as he denounced opponents in politics and business, including the \xe2\x80\x9cpress,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cnegro voters,\xe2\x80\x9d courts, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe Roman Catholic hierarchy.\xe2\x80\x9d Catts framed his victory as a triumph for \xe2\x80\x9cthe common people of Florida, the everyday masses of the cracker people.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en16" href="part0020.html#ch05en16e">16</a></span> While he claimed to fight corruption, he took care of his friends by firing enough old hands in the government to give jobs to his supporters. His use of the spoils system mirrored that of one of his favorite historical figures, Andrew Jackson. At the same time, Catts also promoted genuinely progressive reforms such as initiatives, referenda, recalls, regulation of big businesses, ending the notorious convict-lease system, and starting prison reform, and he was particularly effective in the last two efforts. Catts\xe2\x80\x99s politics embodied a quixotic mix of progress and regression.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Though he finished his political career in a failed run for US Senate in 1920 (losing the Democratic primary with less than 30 percent of the vote), Catts had demonstrated how a blatant appeal to religious, racial, and antiestablishment prejudice in the Gin Crow South could lead to electoral success. While Catts rose like a rocket and fizzled quickly, more stable politicians cleverly deployed the same sense of threat and appeal to deep emotions to promote strict prohibition enforcement as the path to peace through law and order.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en17" href="part0020.html#ch05en17e">17</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-a">Law and Order against Racial and Religious Minorities</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">Even after prohibition was adopted into the constitutions of various states and the United States in 1919, it was still a major issue throughout the South. In the 1920 governor\xe2\x80\x99s race in Texas, for example, the Democratic primary pitted the progressive champion Pat Neff against Joseph Weldon Bailey. Bailey was anti-prohibition, anti\xe2\x80\x93women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage, anti-labor, anti\xe2\x80\x93foreign entanglements, and generally an anti-progressive candidate representing the fiscally conservative and pro\xe2\x80\x93states\xe2\x80\x99 rights Jeffersonian wing of the Democratic Party. The lesser candidates were two progressives, Robert Thomason and Benjamin F. Looney, the very state attorney general who had put Texan brewers out of business for two years with a devastating lawsuit filed in 1915. Bailey won the first-round primary, but Neff won enough votes to challenge him in a runoff, and the progressive backers of Looney and Thomason coalesced behind Neff, giving him victory by more than seventy thousand votes.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en18" href="part0020.html#ch05en18e">18</a></span> Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable performance despite his overt rejection of prohibition (then the law of the land) spoke volumes not only of his ability as a politician but also the persistent strength of anti-prohibition sentiment even as prohibition seemed inevitable.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Nonetheless, Pat Neff\xe2\x80\x99s success signaled how prohibition had conquered the southern political landscape. In the opening speech for his candidacy for governor, Neff declared that he would back \xe2\x80\x9cevery measure that has for its purpose the enforcement of the prohibition amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en19" href="part0020.html#ch05en19e">19</a></span> The measure enacted was the Dean Law, which took effect in October 1919. The law was stricter than the federal Volstead Act in some respects\xe2\x80\x94criminalizing alcohol purchases in addition to alcohol production and sales\xe2\x80\x94yet slightly more lenient in others\xe2\x80\x94only banning drinks with more than 1.0 percent alcoholic content (Volstead banned anything with at least 0.5 percent alcohol).<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en20" href="part0020.html#ch05en20e">20</a></span> On the whole, the Dean Law gave Texas some of the harshest prohibition penalties of any state, though the lack of clear procedures for apprehending and convicting violators made the law relatively ineffective.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en21" href="part0020.html#ch05en21e">21</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Neff\xe2\x80\x99s zeal for enforcing prohibition stemmed from his sense of responsibility to the Texas Constitution and his long experience denouncing alcohol. During his first run for governor, Neff expressed his dedication to the Texas Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s duties of governor, especially Article 4, Section 10: \xe2\x80\x9cHe [<span class="italic">sic</span>] shall cause all of the laws to be faithfully executed.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en22" href="part0020.html#ch05en22e">22</a></span> In addition to executing the laws without partiality, he insisted upon respect for the law. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever tends to weaken respect for the law,\xe2\x80\x9d he stated, \xe2\x80\x9cimperils the nation.\xe2\x80\x9d In the context of prohibition, he was critiquing hypocrisy from legislators who voted dry but personally drank.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en23" href="part0020.html#ch05en23e">23</a></span> Over a decade earlier, as chairman of the Prohibition Campaign Committee of McLennan County, he echoed typical hyperbolic rhetoric about the saloon. It was \xe2\x80\x9cthe chronic criminal of the centuries\xe2\x80\x9d that had \xe2\x80\x9cturned more men into brutes, made more homes unhappy, bribed more courts, defied more laws, corrupted more ballots, caused more tears to fall and more blood to run than any other institution ever legalized by man.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en24" href="part0020.html#ch05en24e">24</a></span> As such, the issue of prohibition was simple: \xe2\x80\x9csaloons or no saloons.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en25" href="part0020.html#ch05en25e">25</a></span> Alcohol was poison, a pure evil, and \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o wrong should be legalized.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en26" href="part0020.html#ch05en26e">26</a></span> With this Manichean view on alcohol, Neff\xe2\x80\x99s push for prohibition included rigid enforcement, though he still believed in changing hearts and minds.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">On the other end of the Democratic South, Governor Westmoreland Davis of Virginia shared Neff\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about overreliance on enforcement of prohibition laws. In 1922, Davis expressed frustration over confusion arising from concurrent enforcement of prohibition laws by the state and federal government. Davis in 1920 had reduced state funding for prohibition enforcement, since he believed the federal government would provide for it, but now he stated, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Federal government so far has failed effectively to enforce prohibition.\xe2\x80\x9d Davis then concluded that the states must take up the burden of enforcing the law, regardless of the cost, since failing to do so would amount to \xe2\x80\x9ca surrender of order to disorder\xe2\x80\x9d and chaos for law enforcement generally.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en27" href="part0020.html#ch05en27e">27</a></span> He approvingly cited a speaker for the National Law Enforcement Convention who called for governments to \xe2\x80\x9cdrastically punish\xe2\x80\x9d offenders of prohibition laws, even as he agreed that \xe2\x80\x9cprincipally we must educate, and practice what we preach.\xe2\x80\x9d Rather than blaming the poor and uneducated for violations, Davis claimed that \xe2\x80\x9clow brows\xe2\x80\x9d only provided liquor because of demand from \xe2\x80\x9chigh brows\xe2\x80\x9d who bought it. The people, especially impressionable youth, followed \xe2\x80\x9cexample rather than . . . precept,\xe2\x80\x9d and Davis suggested that legislators and police themselves led others astray by their illegal drinking: \xe2\x80\x9c<span class="italic">Those who openly and habitually violate the law should not be chosen as law makers or law enforcement officers</span>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis original).

Enforcement of prohibition laws in the South disproportionately targeted African Americans. Historian Lisa McGirr described prohibition as an \xe2\x80\x9cunprecedented campaign of selective enforcement\xe2\x80\x9d in which the poor, immigrants, and African Americans \xe2\x80\x9cexperienced the full brunt\xe2\x80\x9d of the law.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en29" href="part0020.html#ch05en29e">29</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">In Virginia, the long-term jail population doubled from 1923 to 1931 due to prohibition convictions. Overcrowded prisons prompted the state to force convicts to serve on chain gangs building roads, and state regulations decreed that violators of dry laws could be sent to work on those chain gangs, particularly if they could not pay their hefty court fines. Instead of focusing on big-time dealers, law enforcement agents spent most of their time arresting poorer small-time offenders, particularly African Americans. One prohibition agent in Norfolk County, Virginia, arrested primarily African Americans in over a hundred raids in 1924. Even though white and Black workers shared risks together in the bootlegging underworld, African Americans were most often caught and charged with crimes. As one Black newspaper noted, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a certainty that a large percentage of the crimes with which the colored race is charged have to do with bootlegging for white men.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en30" href="part0020.html#ch05en30e">30</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Raids tended to target poor and Black populations, often raiding homes, while police received handsome rewards for more liquor-related arrests. The results were predictable. Police ranks swelled in cities like Richmond, doubling from 1914 to 1929. Officers issued warrants on flimsy grounds such as \xe2\x80\x9cinformation and belief,\xe2\x80\x9d while many arrested for \xe2\x80\x9cpossession and storage\xe2\x80\x9d of a few quarts of whiskey for personal consumption could be sentenced like distillers and bootleggers. Domestic workers and elevator operators seeking to earn a few dollars a day could receive fines of scores or even over a hundred dollars and weeks or months in jail. While the southern white middle class could purchase and consume these goods in relative safety, poor whites and African Americans could be targeted as dangerous drug dealers even when they, too, were just supplementing their income or keeping some alcohol for personal use.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en31" href="part0020.html#ch05en31e">31</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Despite the horrors of hypocritical and racist law enforcement, some African Americans braved the risks for the relative rewards. Flaunting prohibition laws not only earned money but embodied Black resistance to the unjust justice system of Gin Crow. Fannie Lou Hamer\xe2\x80\x99s father, for example, was both a Baptist minister and a bootlegger, teaching his daughter by example to pray, sing, and resist the white power structure. In the Gin Crow South, crime could pay better than playing by the rules, particularly for African Americans whose very skin put them on the wrong side of the law. As the Black newspaper <span class="italic">Pittsburgh Courier</span> stated in 1930, \xe2\x80\x9cFor several years colored citizens here have suffered indignities from policemen and prohibition agents who crash into their homes unlawfully and make liquor searches and arrests in violation of the search and seizure provisions of the law on the pretext of quelling disorder.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en32" href="part0020.html#ch05en32e">32</a></span> If people of color complained about being targeted by police for prohibition violations in the North, how much was there to complain about in the Jim Crow South?<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en33" href="part0020.html#ch05en33e">33</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">White law enforcement in the South had little trouble shooting violators in the back, particularly African Americans. When John Normeley, a Black bootlegger operating near Richmond, fought with agents and then ran away, agents fired several shots into his back, killing him. The agents also murdered Normeley\xe2\x80\x99s unarmed wife by shooting her in the head. A late 1922 raid led by the same agent responsible for the Normeley killings reported shooting twice at a Black bootlegger running away; no attempt was made to excuse the shootings as defensive in any way. While performing their duty in the name of law and order, white agents showed no compunction when offered legal excuses to murder Black men and women who defied prohibition. As African American Edward B. Rembert wrote to President Herbert Hoover, it was hypocritical to insist on enforcement of prohibition laws while Black Americans were being lynched with impunity.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en34" href="part0020.html#ch05en34e">34</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Heavy enforcement of prohibition against Black Americans did not correspond to higher rates of drinking or drunkenness but rather reflected racists attitudes of law enforcement.

Wells \xe2\x80\x9cthe Black wench\xe2\x80\x9d and urged violence against her when she spoke out against lynchings. Carmack was also a failed politician who unsuccessfully ran for governor in the Democratic primary as the dry candidate in 1908. When he was gunned down by a wet rival in a shootout (in which he shot first), and the wet governor pardoned his killer, drys transmogrified the trigger-happy white supremacist into an icon.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">By 1925, while statewide and national prohibition were in effect, Carmack\xe2\x80\x99s admirers in the Anti-Saloon League and Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Christian Temperance Union backed a larger-than-life statue of him on the grounds of the Tennessee state capitol. As historian Patrick O\xe2\x80\x99Daniel wryly observes, the statue\xe2\x80\x99s location is ironic: it resided right next to the Motlow Tunnel, which was funded by money from the estate of Jack Daniel, a famous whiskey distiller whose brand still bears his name.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en36" href="part0020.html#ch05en36e">36</a></span> The statue remained there for nearly a century until May 30, 2020, when protesters toppled it as a symbol of white supremacism.

Atticus Webb, head of the Texas Anti-Saloon League (TASL), promoted such leagues in February 1921 as both a carrot and a stick for police. On the one hand, they aimed to \xe2\x80\x9crally the mass of the people to strong moral support of the efforts at law enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d On the other hand, they would \xe2\x80\x9cprod up any officials that are negligent of their duty.\xe2\x80\x9d One such \xe2\x80\x9claw and order\xe2\x80\x9d meeting in Dallas solicited a telegram from Neff, which the crowd of hundreds received with \xe2\x80\x9cdeafening\xe2\x80\x9d applause.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en38" href="part0020.html#ch05en38e">38</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">\xe2\x80\x9cLaw and order\xe2\x80\x9d in the South implied not only white supremacy, but also Anglo supremacy against recent immigrants. A November 1915 article on a wet parade in Chicago that month called the participants, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9ca crowd of undesirable hyphenated Americans, whose hyphen is bigger than their Americanism,\xe2\x80\x9d who \xe2\x80\x9chave no respect for the law that requires their conformity to American customs and . . .

A second Ku Klux Klan (KKK) was founded by William Joseph Simmons in Atlanta in 1915 months after the blockbuster film <span class="italic">The Birth of a Nation</span> praised the first Klan. The Klan rose to national political prominence by the early 1920s under the leadership of a southerner, Hiram Wesley Evans, who tightly associated the Klan not only with opposition to Black rights, but with white \xe2\x80\x9cnative\xe2\x80\x9d Americanism, anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism, and support for prohibition. Its support of prohibition helped justify racist and xenophobic vigilantism in the name of \xe2\x80\x9claw and order.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en41" href="part0020.html#ch05en41e">41</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">While the second KKK grew around the nation, its cause was linked with southern white identity. The KKK made its first major public appearance in Texas in Houston in October 1920 at a parade celebrating the United Confederate Veterans. By 1922 Klan membership rose to some 150,000 in Texas alone and over a million throughout the nation. The Texas Klan, however, was not as virulently anti-Jewish or anti-Catholic as some of its counterparts further North: it did not burn crosses against Catholics or Jews as much as some Klans in the North did. Instead, the Texas Klan, as with chapters throughout the South, focused primarily on keeping Blacks \xe2\x80\x9cin their place\xe2\x80\x9d and promoting reforms such as prohibition. Nonetheless, in the Second Klan, anti-Catholicism and anti-Semitism was a matter of degree, not kind.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The swift ascension of a Dallas dentist, Hiram Wesley Evans, through the organization\xe2\x80\x99s hierarchy embodied the meteoric rise of the Klan in American life. He joined the Klan in 1920 and by 1922 had risen to state leader (\xe2\x80\x9cgreat titan\xe2\x80\x9d), national secretary (\xe2\x80\x9cimperial kligrapp\xe2\x80\x9d), and finally national director (\xe2\x80\x9cimperial wizard\xe2\x80\x9d), a role in which he continued until 1939. The year Evans became imperial wizard, 1922, he launched a program to elect Klansmen to offices across the South and across the nation. That year, the Klan dominated the city governments of Dallas, Fort Worth, and Wichita Falls, and likely controlled the majority in the Texas House of Representatives. Most brazenly, the Klan openly lobbied in the Democratic primary and general election for a fellow Klansman and staunch dry, Earle Bradford Mayfield, who won an election to the US Senate with the reluctant backing of the ASL. Even Texas governor Pat Neff, while generically denouncing extralegal violence and denying personal involvement with the Klan, refused to denounce the organization by name. The Klan seemed unstoppable.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en42" href="part0020.html#ch05en42e">42</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">In its heyday, the Klan received positive attention from many Protestants, even pastors, though not all. Methodist clergy such as J. T. Renfro of Dallas and Alonzo Monk of Arlington abandoned their pulpits to lecture for the Klan, and with some regularity Klansmen in full regalia interrupted funerals and church services, sometimes giving pastors small amounts of money to express their piety. While most Protestant clergy said little against the Klan, some ministers were less than enthusiastic about the Invisible Empire. The Klan\xe2\x80\x99s excesses outraged even J. B. Cranfill, the aging militant dry famous for his racist comments in 1887. In April 1922, Cranfill wrote to a friend, \xe2\x80\x9cNever, until the advent of the Ku Klux Klan, did the Baptists persecute anybody\xe2\x80\x9d; but now, under Klan pressure, many Baptists \xe2\x80\x9care joining in the persecution of the negroes, the Jews, the Catholics and the foreigners.\xe2\x80\x9d While his blanket denial of Baptists persecuting anybody before the Klan is dubious, especially given his virulent diatribes against Blacks and Catholics, Cranfill\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of Klan violence as undermining Baptist principles is remarkable and unequivocal. When \xe2\x80\x9cany Baptist anywhere joins hands with any movement and sows the seeds of race prejudice and intolerance,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cthen uses subterranean methods of procedure, by that much he loses his grip on the age-long principles of the Baptist people.\xe2\x80\x9d The Klan\xe2\x80\x99s invective was so great that even bigots like Cranfill blanched. While many Methodists and Baptists joined or supported the Klan, at least a few ministers saw the clandestine organization as betraying the principles of their faith.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en43" href="part0020.html#ch05en43e">43</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">One violent incident captures the multivalent bigotry of the Klan in Texas.

The atrocity (ignored by law enforcement) was an explicit attack on an innocent African American but was also an implicit attack on the German American beer baron Adolphus Busch, who built the European-style luxury hotel in 1912 at the behest of city founders.

While the bitter divide between Smith and McAdoo led the convention to settle on a compromise candidate after a ten-day deadlock, Smith contented himself to serving four more years as New York\xe2\x80\x99s governor and gearing up for the Democratic nomination in 1928, where he was the overwhelming favorite.

By 1928, it was Catholics, not prohibitionist Protestants, who needed to combat charges of uniting church and state.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">The first signs of trouble came from the lack of southern support for Smith\xe2\x80\x99s nomination in Houston. Delegations from Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Missouri, and Texas had all refused to endorse Smith, while Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Kansas split their support. Of all the southern states, only a few delegations from the upper and border South\xe2\x80\x94Tennessee, Arkansas, and Maryland\xe2\x80\x94had given unequivocal support to Al Smith, even though Smith surpassed the two-thirds threshold for nomination on the first ballot. Some of this lack of support is explained in a remark by Cone Johnson, one dry Texas delegate to the convention: \xe2\x80\x9cI sat by the central aisle while the parade passed following Smith\xe2\x80\x99s nomination and the faces I saw in that mile-long procession were not American faces. I wondered where were the Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en60" href="part0020.html#ch05en60e">60</a></span> For nativist southern drys, anti-Catholicism fit naturally with their \xe2\x80\x9c100-percent\xe2\x80\x9d Americanism and anti-immigrant sentiment.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Despite the chorus of many southerners against Smith, Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s former US senator Oscar Underwood\xe2\x80\x94a proud wet\xe2\x80\x94backed Smith as early as 1927. In December 1927, Underwood believed Smith was \xe2\x80\x9cbest qualified to fill the office\xe2\x80\x9d and would easily win both the party\xe2\x80\x99s nomination and the presidency. However, Underwood was by far the exception in the South. His opposition to the Klan in 1924 alienated many southern white voters, and he declined to run for reelection in 1926 rather than face almost certain defeat. A sign of the times was Underwood\xe2\x80\x99s successor, Hugo Black, who had been a member of the KKK from September 1923 to July 1925, when he resigned to run for the US Senate. Despite their different views on the Klan, Black shared one similarity with Underwood: both backed Al Smith for president.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en61" href="part0020.html#ch05en61e">61</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Anti-Catholic southerners continued to denounce Al Smith, and none more loudly than Fort Worth First Baptist Church\xe2\x80\x99s pastor, J. Frank Norris. He was a die-hard fundamentalist pastor with a booming congregation of five thousand and a penchant for attacking anyone more theologically liberal than he was (which was nearly everyone). His assaults against more moderate Southern Baptists led to Norris\xe2\x80\x99s expulsion from the Texas Baptist General Convention and alienation from the Southern Baptist Convention.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Yet Norris saved his worst vitriol for Catholics. As far back as 1922, in a sermon he detailed a slaughter of Huguenot Protestants by Catholics in the French Wars of Religion three and a half centuries earlier, then declared, \xe2\x80\x9cThis same bloody beast now undertakes to control the politics of this country.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en62" href="part0020.html#ch05en62e">62</a></span> Then when Fort Worth tried to buy property from the Catholic Church in July 1926, Norris claimed that the city\xe2\x80\x99s mayor, H. C. Meacham, and city manager, H. B. Carr, were involved in a pro-Catholic conspiracy. His fight against Catholicism turned lethal that month when in his office he shot dead an unarmed D. E. Chipps, a Catholic and prominent businessman. Incredibly, Norris was acquitted by a jury that apparently bought his story: Norris fired in self-defense, since Chipps was part of a Catholic conspiracy to kill Norris for speaking out against them.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en63" href="part0020.html#ch05en63e">63</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">By 1924 Norris had denounced Catholicism as \xe2\x80\x9canti-American and unconstitutional\xe2\x80\x9d and declared that no Catholic could honestly take the oath of office to become president because Catholics obeyed the Pope above any terrestrial authority, including the United States.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en64" href="part0020.html#ch05en64e">64</a></span> Norris reiterated this claim in 1927: \xe2\x80\x9cNo true consistent Roman Catholic, my friends, who actually believes in the doctrine of papal infallibility, can be true to any other government in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en65" href="part0020.html#ch05en65e">65</a></span> While many respectable Protestants agreed with Norris on that point, he mingled rejection of Catholic theology with denigration of Catholic immigrants, whom he referred to as \xe2\x80\x9clow-browed foreigners.\xe2\x80\x9d He also connected biblical Christian (Protestant) faith with true American patriotism: \xe2\x80\x9cAs far as we are concerned,\xe2\x80\x9d he bellowed, \xe2\x80\x9cwe stand for 100 percent Americanism; for the Bible; for the home, and against every evil and against every foreign influence that seeks to corrupt and undermine our cherished and Christian institutions.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en66" href="part0020.html#ch05en66e">66</a></span> For a white dry Southern Baptist like Norris, for whom prohibition embodied \xe2\x80\x9cour cherished and Christian institutions,\xe2\x80\x9d a German Irish Catholic wet Yankee like Al Smith running for president of the United States was anathema to everything southern whites held dear.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Norris trained his sights directly on Smith as early as 1926, when Smith was the presumed but not yet official nominee of the Democratic Party for president. In an article titled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Conspiracy of Rum and Romanism to Rule This Government,\xe2\x80\x9d Norris argued that Catholics believed their church was supreme in all things, infallible, and unalterable, then pointedly asked, \xe2\x80\x9cAre we ready to permit a man to occupy the highest office, the chief magistracy over this Government, who owes his first allegiance to a foreign power which claims these three things?\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en67" href="part0020.html#ch05en67e">67</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Norris was not alone in fearing that a Catholic president could not separate his earthly politics from his spiritual allegiance to a foreign Pope. In 1927, jurist Charles C. Marshall of New York wrote \xe2\x80\x9cAn Open Letter to the Honorable Alfred E. Smith\xe2\x80\x9d in the <span class="italic">Atlantic Monthly</span> which essentially asked the same question Norris was asking (if in a different spirit): how could a Catholic who maintains the supremacy of the Catholic magisterium\xe2\x80\x94particularly, the Pope\xe2\x80\x94in earthly matters be a fully loyal US citizen, much less president? The open letter prompted Al Smith himself to issue a reply that was in turn published in major newspapers around the country. Norris reprinted Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s article\xe2\x80\x94without Smith\xe2\x80\x99s reply.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en68" href="part0020.html#ch05en68e">68</a></span> Protestant concerns about a Catholic politician\xe2\x80\x99s ability to separate his duties to church and state had forced Al Smith, rather than Protestant \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical preachers\xe2\x80\x9d like Norris, on the defensive.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Even before Al Smith became an issue, Norris\xe2\x80\x99s inflexible principles had led him to buck the Democratic Party, a nearly unforgiveable sin in the Solid South. The son of an alcoholic, Norris gained a fresh passion for prohibition politics when he met Morris Sheppard in 1919. Afterward, Norris was so touched by meeting prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s champion in the US Senate that he gave Sheppard a silver set boasting that his church had \xe2\x80\x9cthe largest Sunday School in America\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and more importantly, Norris dove into prohibition politics. Norris clashed with a federal judge who supposedly sentenced bootleggers too leniently and backed Klan members like Mayfield for Senate in 1922 and Robertson against Ma Ferguson for governor in 1924. In the latter contest, he wrote articles with sensational titles like, \xe2\x80\x9cIs Liquor Coming Back?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCan You Vote with the Bootlegger?\xe2\x80\x9d Though Norris promised to respect the result of the Democratic primary after Ma Ferguson won, ads for her Republican challenger appeared in his paper.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en69" href="part0020.html#ch05en69e">69</a></span> It is unsurprising, then, that as early as the spring of 1927, Norris had coordinated with R. B. Creager, a member of the Republican National Committee, on how to defeat Al Smith at the polls, and in 1928 embarked on a regional tour to ensure the wet Catholic\xe2\x80\x99s defeat.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en70" href="part0020.html#ch05en70e">70</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Norris\xe2\x80\x99s most notorious and perhaps most revealing rant against Catholics in his campaigning for the GOP candidate, Herbert Hoover, occurred in August 1928 before a crowd of six thousand in Dallas. After a woman interrupted his speech with swearing and was removed, Norris roared:</p>\n<p class="x-ex-np">Now, we are prepared to have order here tonight. We are not surprised at the lowdown whiskey-soaked imps of Hell. The toe-kissing Tammanyites are here for the purpose of creating a disturbance, and I will serve notice on you now that this is Texas and not Mexico. Now, you who are here to disturb this meeting, get up on your hind feet and stand where we can see you. . . . Now, we will proceed and I call upon all red-blooded white folks here tonight, who love God, who love the flag, and who love order, to exercise your rights as American citizens and see to it that none of this ring-kissing Tammany Hall gang cause any more interference or disturbance.<span class="superscript1"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en71" href="part0020.html#ch05en71e">71</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">For Norris and his six thousand listeners, God was on the side of America, the \xe2\x80\x9corder\xe2\x80\x9d of prohibition laws, and Protestant \xe2\x80\x9cred-blooded white folks\xe2\x80\x9d against Mexico, \xe2\x80\x9cwhiskey-soaked imps of Hell,\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cring-kissing Tammany Hall gang\xe2\x80\x9d of recent Catholic immigrants. The campaign for Hoover was for many southern Protestants a campaign against demonic, semi-animal, nonwhite, corrupt, and Catholic foreigners.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Norris was just one of thousands of Protestant pastors across the South who opposed Al Smith in 1928 while claiming that Catholics, not themselves, posed the real threat to the separation of church and state. Even Norris\xe2\x80\x99s erstwhile enemies in the Southern Baptist Convention did likewise. The president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, L. R. Scarborough, wrote an article in which he began with a careful evaluation of the state-church issues and descended into claims of Smith\xe2\x80\x99s alcoholism before announcing his support for a more \xe2\x80\x9cChristian\xe2\x80\x9d (that is, Protestant) candidate, Hoover.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en72" href="part0020.html#ch05en72e">72</a></span> Baptists were joined by clergy in the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (MECS), who opposed Smith as a bloc. One survey of eighty-five hundred ministers of the MECS throughout the South found only four who openly supported Al Smith for president.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en73" href="part0020.html#ch05en73e">73</a></span> Church conferences across the South lined up against Smith.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en74" href="part0020.html#ch05en74e">74</a></span> Even Protestant ministers who at other times squabbled with each other formed a united front against the perceived menace of a Catholic takeover of the US government. This army of white southern Democrats for Hoover took on a new name: Hoovercrats.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">One of the most prominent Hoovercrats in the South was a Southern Methodist bishop, James Cannon Jr. He had served as leader of the Virginia ASL, helped turn that state dry by 1916, and was rewarded with the rank of bishop in 1918. After the death of Wayne B. Wheeler in September 1927, Cannon became the most visible national leader in the ASL, and he regarded it as his duty to stop Smith\xe2\x80\x94whom he said would be a \xe2\x80\x9cCocktail President\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94at all costs.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en75" href="part0020.html#ch05en75e">75</a></span> As early as November 1927, Cannon urged his fellow Virginia Methodists to buck the Democratic Party if necessary to preserve prohibition. After Smith accepted the Democratic nomination and expressed his intention to modify prohibition laws, Cannon joined with a Southern Baptist colleague, Arthur Barton, to denounce Smith and organize likeminded southern Democrats. He collaborated with C. Bascom Slemp, a Republican congressman from Virginia, to rally the anti-Smith forces. He also brushed off criticisms from southern traditionalist bishops such as Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s Warren Candler and Richmond\xe2\x80\x99s Collins Denny that he should \xe2\x80\x9cPreach Christ and him crucified\xe2\x80\x9d instead of politics. In response, Cannon joined with other progressive bishops such as the Texan Edwin D. Mouzon to affirm their political preaching: \xe2\x80\x9cThe moral forces of the country will not be driven from the field by the cry that they are \xe2\x80\x98brining the Church into politics.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Cannon declared defiantly, \xe2\x80\x9cI absolutely decline to be muzzled.\xe2\x80\x9d Cannon clashed with Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s powerful Byrd Machine, which remained faithful to Smith, particularly the lay Methodist politician and US Senator Carter Glass. And, aside from a few weeks\xe2\x80\x99 rest for his health, he campaigned hard not only in his home state of Virginia but across the South: Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and even Oklahoma.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en76" href="part0020.html#ch05en76e">76</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Cannon also joined in the chorus of anti-Catholic rhetoric. Smith provoked reaction by appointing John J. Raskob, a wealthy Republican, militant wet, and Roman Catholic, as chair of the Democratic National Committee and then giving a speech on September 20, 1928, in which he denounced the Klan and other detractors as anti-Catholic. Cannon and other anti-Smith Democrats bristled at the accusation that they were intolerant, then proceeded to attack Smith\xe2\x80\x99s faith. Cannon claimed that \xe2\x80\x9cWet, Roman Catholic\xe2\x80\x9d bosses of northern cities\xe2\x80\x94like the notoriously corrupt Tammany Hall\xe2\x80\x94were taking over their Democratic Party. While many northerners joined in the anti-Catholic crusade, including Methodist minister Deets Picket, US prohibition enforcement generalissimo Mabel Walker Willebrandt and fundamentalist Baptist pastor John Roach Stratton, Cannon took on a prominent role in the South. Three weeks before the election, Cannon issued a circular rhetorically entitled <span class="italic">Is Southern Protestantism More Intolerant Than Romanism?</span> (Answer: no.) The circular was deliberately polemic, or as he put it: \xe2\x80\x9cI made it just as hot as I could.\xe2\x80\x9d He charged Smith and Raskob were peddling \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate and malicious political falsehoods.\xe2\x80\x9d After repeatedly denying he was bigoted, he claimed the Catholic Church was against American tolerance and democratic values, including \xe2\x80\x9cfreedom of action, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of conscience, freedom of education, free Democratic Government as we have it, free church in a free state, and the salvation of any outside the Roman Church.\xe2\x80\x9d While he was not the most virulently anti-Catholic voice against Smith, he certainly fought back fiercely when he felt he needed to defend his honor.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en77" href="part0020.html#ch05en77e">77</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">An even more vituperative Hoovercrat than Cannon was \xe2\x80\x9cCotton Tom\xe2\x80\x9d Heflin, whose white supremacism (including his attempted murder of a Black man in 1908) was matched only by his anti-Catholicism. In January 1928 on the floor of the US Senate, Heflin described attempts to denounce the Klan at the Democratic Convention in 1924 as dividing the party and \xe2\x80\x9cput[ting] Roman Catholic government above everything, above the Democratic Party, and above their country.\xe2\x80\x9d Since by that time Al Smith was the favored nominee of the party, Heflin repeatedly called upon the American people to wake up and ready themselves for battle against Smith, who would help the Pope \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol this country,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmake America Catholic,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clay the heavy hand of a Catholic state upon you and crush the life out of Protestantism in America.\xe2\x80\x9d Heflin did not limit his attacks to the floor of Congress, but spoke to large crowds in Birmingham, Montgomery, and elsewhere to attack Smith, African Americans, and attempts to repeal the Eighteenth Amendment.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en78" href="part0020.html#ch05en78e">78</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Even before Heflin joined the Hoovercrats, another US senator from the South took a bold anti-Smith stance: Furnifold McLendel Simmons of North Carolina. As chairman of the Democratic state committee, Simmons had helped lead the white-supremacist campaign that led to the Wilmington Massacre of 1898 and disfranchised African Americans in the state for half a century. After taking a seat in the Senate in 1901, Simmons served there for thirty years, during which time he set up a powerful political machine. Upset by Smith\xe2\x80\x99s wet stance, connections with Tammany Hall, immigrant background, and cooperation with African Americans while governor of New York, Simmons refused to endorse Smith.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en79" href="part0020.html#ch05en79e">79</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Despite their strong Democratic leanings in the South, the ASL branches followed Bishop Cannon to vigorously oppose Smith. The <span class="italic">Home and State</span> printed articles by Methodist Church leaders as early as 1927, calling on Democrats not to vote for Smith the next year should he be the nominee. By September 1928, nearly the entire issue of <span class="italic">Home and State</span> was filled with anti\xe2\x80\x93Al Smith rhetoric, including a report that the Texas ASL had formed a \xe2\x80\x9cNon-Partisan Hoover League of Texas\xe2\x80\x9d to oppose the Democratic nominee.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en80" href="part0020.html#ch05en80e">80</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Unlike Norris, however, the Texas ASL went out of its way to avoid explicitly criticizing Catholics as such but were openly paranoid about Smith\xe2\x80\x99s interracial record. While drys such as the fundamentalist lightning rod J. Frank Norris fiercely attacked the Democratic presidential candidate for his immigrant Catholic family, the <span class="italic">Home and State</span> scarcely mentioned Al Smith\xe2\x80\x99s religion or immigrant background.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en81" href="part0020.html#ch05en81e">81</a></span> After months of denouncing Smith as a wet, only one article in July 1928 obliquely objected to Smith\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy on the grounds of Catholicism, citing \xe2\x80\x9cthe liquor and religious [that is, Catholic] issues.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en82" href="part0020.html#ch05en82e">82</a></span> Shortly after the election, the <span class="italic">Home and State</span> ran an article titled \xe2\x80\x9cAnti-Saloon League Not Opposed to Smith Because of His Religion,\xe2\x80\x9d which speaks for itself.

He claimed that, in New York, \xe2\x80\x9cwhite women in a dance hall were in the arms of negro men,\xe2\x80\x9d and Black teachers taught Black and white children in the same classroom. Such examples clearly insinuated that Smith\xe2\x80\x99s presidency might undermine Jim Crow segregation in the South. When Virginia Democrats claimed that Hoover did not share their white-supremacist views, Cannon claimed that Hoover segregated workers by race while at Smith\xe2\x80\x99s Tammany Hall, white women worked as secretaries for Black men, a clear violation of gendered and racial taboos. Cannon also lumped Smith with recent immigrant groups. He told a Maryland crowd that old-stock immigrants were \xe2\x80\x9cpeople like yourselves\xe2\x80\x94English, Scotch, Dutch and German\xe2\x80\x94. . . honorable\xe2\x80\x9d people \xe2\x80\x9cwho make good citizens,\xe2\x80\x9d but that Smith wanted \xe2\x80\x9cthe Italians, the Sicilians, the Poles and the Russian Jew,\xe2\x80\x9d the kind that \xe2\x80\x9chas given us a stomach-ache.\xe2\x80\x9d Because the latter are \xe2\x80\x9cunable to assimilate . . . we shut the door to them,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cSmith says, \xe2\x80\x98give me that kind of people.\xe2\x80\x99 He wants the kind of people that you find today on the sidewalks of New York.\xe2\x80\x9d For leading southern drys like Cannon, upholding Jim Crow, keeping out recent immigrants, and promoting white evangelical Americanism were threads of the same fabric.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en89" href="part0020.html#ch05en89e">89</a></span> Hoovercrats such as US Senators Heflin of Alabama and Simmons of North Carolina joined Cannon in deploying anti-Black and anti-immigrant rhetoric against Smith.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en90" href="part0020.html#ch05en90e">90</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">For their part, some Black leaders in the North supported the dry Republican candidate in 1928. That September, Kelly Miller, a sociology professor at Howard University, wrote in September of 1928: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Negro is the chief victim of the liquor demon,\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cEighteenth Amendment . . . has been a godsend to his race.\xe2\x80\x9d Miller framed his argument in terms of Christian morality. The best argument for prohibition \xe2\x80\x9cfor thoughtful Christian people\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cbased on our responsibility for those who are not strong enough to resist temptation.\xe2\x80\x9d For Miller, Christians could come to no other position than prohibition: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no escape for a Christian from the bedrock proposition that \xe2\x80\x98we who are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d and as such, \xe2\x80\x9cThe state should of right remove temptation from those who have not the inhibition to withstand temptation.\xe2\x80\x9d Miller expressed the belief of some Black leaders as late as 1928 that prohibition, and therefore voting for the dry candidate Hoover, remained a Christian imperative.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en91" href="part0020.html#ch05en91e">91</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Looking back in 1935, however, Miller remarked that unequal policing policies had a negative effect on Black communities. \xe2\x80\x9cToo often the policeman\xe2\x80\x99s club is the only instrument of the law with which the Negro comes into contact. This engenders in him a distrust and resentful attitude toward all public authorities and law officers.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en92" href="part0020.html#ch05en92e">92</a></span> Given the disproportionate enforcement of prohibition laws against poor and Black citizens in the South, Miller\xe2\x80\x99s remarks seemed to fit a critique of prohibition. Back in 1928, however, Miller\xe2\x80\x99s dry stance underlined many Black elites\xe2\x80\x99 lingering support for the Republican Party just a few years before the New Deal arrived and eventually shifted most Black support to the Democrats. With a critical mass of northern whites and Blacks and southern whites supporting Hoover, Smith\xe2\x80\x99s defeat seemed sure.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">In the South, however, Black voters were so few that their votes apparently made little difference in the outcome. The disfranchisement wrought a decade earlier by prohibition and the end of their alliance with the brewers rendered most unable to pay poll taxes, much less pass other restrictive voting requirements. While white women had gained the right to vote (provided they, too, paid a poll tax), Black women were doubly disadvantaged, denied suffrage while their white sisters enjoyed it. In this prohibition-focused election, Black southerners were on the sidelines.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Election Aftermath</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">On election day, Al Smith was crushed by Republican Herbert Hoover, who took nearly half of the formerly Confederate states, including Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Old-stock white Protestants around the country opposed Smith for many reasons\xe2\x80\x94he was a Catholic, wet, urbanite, and child of immigrants with a grating accent of New York\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Ward. In their crusade against rum and Romanism, southern drys had finally turned against the Democratic Party itself. Yet the drys\xe2\x80\x99 victory came at a high cost. The contest\xe2\x80\x99s bitter rhetoric divided the South\xe2\x80\x99s overwhelmingly white voters and countless Southern Baptist and Methodist congregations down the middle. Some devoted Methodist laymen such as Morris Sheppard, champion of the Eighteenth Amendment in the US Senate, had supported Al Smith out of loyalty to the Democratic Party while figures like Norris remained Republican activists even after the election.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en93" href="part0020.html#ch05en93e">93</a></span> Though several southern states had broken their tradition of siding with the Democratic presidential candidate, the GOP win in 1928 did not fundamentally change the Democratic stranglehold on the region. Even while losing several states, Smith still carried the core of the South: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en94" href="part0020.html#ch05en94e">94</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">Some Hoovercrats suffered electorally for bucking the Democratic Party establishment, and they either exited politics or returned to the fold. In 1928, the once-promising US senator (and Klan member) Mayfield lost his primary election to Tom Connally. When Mayfield ran for governor in 1930, he placed seventh in a crowded field, and his political career was finished. North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s senator Simmons helped tip his state vote for Hoover in 1928, but two years later he lost his Senate primary to a party loyalist, Josiah Bailey.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en95" href="part0020.html#ch05en95e">95</a></span> Alabama senator \xe2\x80\x9cCotton Tom\xe2\x80\x9d Heflin suffered a similar fate in 1930. Heflin\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor in the US Senate was the late John Bankhead, and in 1930 he lost a primary against John Bankhead II, the former senator\xe2\x80\x99s son, by fifty thousand votes. Though Heflin claimed fraud and formally protested for years, his protest was dismissed. Heflin eventually reconciled with party elites, serving in various federal appointments in the 1930s and early 1940s. By 1948, near the end of his life, he reversed his antiestablishment stance of two decades earlier and supported the Democratic nominee, Harry Truman, against the insurgent Dixiecrats.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en96" href="part0020.html#ch05en96e">96</a></span> The absence of a Catholic on the ticket made it easier for erstwhile Hoovercrats to return to the party faithful in the 1930s and 1940s.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Drys took Hoover\xe2\x80\x99s victory as a national referendum on prohibition that settled the question, so most dry pastors withdrew from partisan politics thereafter. As Jeanne Bozzell McCarty has demonstrated in her study of Protestants and prohibition in Texas from 1919 to 1935, most drys, content that prohibition had been saved in 1928, still supported enforcement but in their everyday work tended more to the Gospel message. The editor of the <span class="italic">Baptist Standard</span> pleaded two weeks after the 1928 election for preachers to avoid the \xe2\x80\x9cconscientious compulsion\xe2\x80\x9d to perpetually engage divisive political issues and focus more on \xe2\x80\x9cChrist and Him Crucified.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en97" href="part0020.html#ch05en97e">97</a></span> The editor of another paper, the <span class="italic">Christian Courier,</span> which had openly supported Hoover in the campaign, echoed this theme, pleading: \xe2\x80\x9clet the servants of God turn with new energy to the every-day task of the church\xe2\x80\x94the preaching of the gospel of Christ, the seeking of the lost, the edifying of saints. . . . Not Hoover, but Christ is the Savior.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en98" href="part0020.html#ch05en98e">98</a></span> Another issue of the <span class="italic">Courier</span> stated baldly, \xe2\x80\x9cAdios, Politics!\xe2\x80\x9d and restated the paper\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to focus on matters of salvation.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en99" href="part0020.html#ch05en99e">99</a></span> While support for prohibition did not waver among most Protestant clergy after the election, the emphasis of many shifted more towards soul-saving work and away from politics.</p>\n<p class="x-a">Conclusion</p>\n<p class="x-txtf">In the South, opposition to Catholics played an increasing role in prohibitionists\xe2\x80\x99 rhetoric, and suspicion of a union of church and state shifted from Protestant \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical preachers\xe2\x80\x9d to Catholic politicians. Anti-Catholicism was incidental before prohibition became law, expressed mostly indirectly at \xe2\x80\x9cforeign\xe2\x80\x9d ethnic groups such as Germans and Mexicans, and prohibitionists openly courted Catholics, some of whom drys celebrated when they came out in favor of prohibition. Only in 1928 did Protestants in the South seriously link Catholic religion with anti-prohibition and unleash a full barrage of rhetoric questioning the loyalty and American credentials of all Catholics. A similar story held for shifting accusations of who was mixing church and state. Initially, dry Protestants were defending themselves against charges of wrongly mixing church and state, but by 1928 prohibition was the law of the land, and anti-prohibition Catholics were responding to that charge.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Rather than featuring coalitions along more or less static religious and cultural lines, polarizing political moral issues like prohibition can produce evolving cultural and religious alliances that alternately woo and demonize certain constituencies. Even accusations of uniting church and state can rebound from advocates of a moral reform to its detractors, particularly when the reform has changed from fringe view to established law. Southern Democrats once accused of supporting \xe2\x80\x9cRum, Romanism, and Rebellion\xe2\x80\x9d just a few decades later denounced alcohol, maligned Catholics, and voted Republican.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Drys\xe2\x80\x99 triumph in 1928, however, proved a pyrrhic victory. Public opinion gradually shifted against prohibition as it failed to live up to its promises of a better world and grew increasingly associated with its most extreme and vitriolic champions. While prohibition initially reduced drinking in the early 1920s, many came to believe that prohibition had betrayed its millennial hope for social improvement and instead only made society worse by insistence upon draconian laws. A growing emphasis on strict enforcement of the law marginalized efforts to change hearts and minds. The Ku Klux Klan in Texas in the early 1920s tainted prohibition with its strange mix of law-and-order rhetoric with extralegal violence. Aggressively dry pastors like J. Frank Norris, who pushed for prohibition at all costs in the 1928 election, created a backlash against prohibition. As his biographer described it, Norris by 1929 had shown \xe2\x80\x9can almost pathological anger in the face of continued attacks on prohibition.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="ch05en100" href="part0020.html#ch05en100e">100</a></span> The pugnacious style of drys like him drove many moderates to shy away from prohibition by the end of the decade. Increasing skepticism towards prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s ever more pugilistic champions dovetailed with growing affection for repeal. When prohibition repeal came South in the 1930s, some of its champions came from a demographic once thought to be the cornerstone of a permanent dry majority: white women.</p>\n</body></html>\n'</p>
