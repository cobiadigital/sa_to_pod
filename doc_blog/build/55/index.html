      <p class="body text-start"><p>In Jaqualine Kelm&#39;s book, Appreciative Living she further lays out the constructionist principle:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Life is not experienced in a vacuum. We simultaneously integrate our past and present beliefs as we construct a new reality with others. As we hear over and over from different sources that being responsible is a good way to live, we begin to view that as &quot;truth.&quot; We come to believe that it is better to follow the rules, do what we promise, and adhere to the standards and norms of our society. We carry that truth into our next experience and act accordingly. It is only &quot;truth&quot;¬ù for us, from our relative perspective and framework of understanding. It will be viewed differently by others.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What&#39;s one thing you are grateful for?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It could be a conversation you had... a few moments of walking in the sun... a particular feeling...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Name another thing...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Name a third...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now think about what role you played in these three things.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What is something, no matter how small, you can do today that will bring you joy?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It could be ride a bike, bake cookies, play some music...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our own life is the instrument with which we experiment with truth13. ~Thich Nhat Hanh</p>
