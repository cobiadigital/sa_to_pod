The name \xe2\x80\x9cBourbon\xe2\x80\x9d also had connections to the Marquis de Lafayette, who was descended from that line, thus linking the American Bourbons to the early independence period and Lafayette\xe2\x80\x99s friend Thomas Jefferson. In some states, such as Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s home state of Virginia, the ruling party preferred to call itself \xe2\x80\x9cConservative\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cDemocrat\xe2\x80\x9d for some years after Reconstruction. These Bourbons saw themselves as the defenders of the South\xe2\x80\x99s traditions against the radical reforms of Republican Reconstruction. And one of those traditions the Bourbons defended was the production, sale, and consumption of alcoholic beverages, including the native southern drink, bourbon.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">First crafted in Virginia (later eastern Kentucky) in the late-eighteenth century, bourbon whiskey is corn-based and aged in charred oak casks, giving it a distinctive taste and reddish color.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="part01en1" href="part0020.html#part01en1e">1</a></span> The drink likely took its name from its birthplace, Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s capacious Bourbon County, which was subsequently broken up into over a dozen counties after Kentucky became a state in 1792. Part of that region became Kentucky\xe2\x80\x99s Bourbon County, which hosted many bourbon distilleries as early as 1785, further cementing the connection between the name and the drink. The product grew in quality and popularity over the years, and the name \xe2\x80\x9cbourbon\xe2\x80\x9d became widespread by the 1840s to distinguish it from other forms of whiskey. European distillers and vintners in 1960 gave American bourbon a special status reserved for other national beverages such as Scotch whiskey and French cognac. Congress declared bourbon a \xe2\x80\x9cdistinctive product of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d in 1964 and clarified that, among other rules, true bourbon must be crafted in the United States. The Kentucky Bourbon Trail, officially established in 1999, attracts over a million visitors annually to enjoy this national treasure in its natural habitat.<span class="superscript"><a class="nounder" id="part01en2" href="part0020.html#part01en2e">2</a></span></p>\n<p class="x-txt">This happy overlap between the conservative Bourbon Democrats and the South\xe2\x80\x99s distinctive drink did not begin or end with a naming coincidence. Opposition to alcohol prohibition in the South in the late-nineteenth century was conservative in every sense of the word because prohibition threatened the existing social, political, and theological order. Theologically, traditionalist Christians opposed prohibition for its challenge to older ideas about temperance, the Bible, communion wine, and liberty. Politically and socially, some prohibitionists proposed radical changes from giving women the right to vote to promoting potent multiracial political coalitions for statewide elections in the 1880s, just a few short years after Bourbons had tried to eliminate African Americans as a force in southern politics. While the South in the early twentieth century would become a dry citadel, in the late-nineteenth century it was, in every sense, under Bourbon rule.</p>\n</body></html>\n'</p>
