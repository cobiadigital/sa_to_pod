More importantly, though, southern white drys endorsed Jim Crow laws in the 1890s in part because they believed it was the only reliable path to prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s success. The attempted interracial prohibition coalitions in the 1880s failed, leading white drys to blame Black voters for their failures. White drys increasingly sought to advance white supremacy through the punitive legal measures of Jim Crow, particularly voter suppression. Concern with suppressing Black votes permeated the publications of white drys. Many whites worried aloud that the prohibition issue could divide the white vote and so give a decisive role to African American voters in elections.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Because of the hardening of racial views among most white drys, African American participation in local and statewide prohibition elections during the early Jim Crow period was effectively a form of resistance to Jim Crow. White supremacists had effectively used Jim Crow laws to disfranchise the majority of African Americans by the first decade of the twentieth century, and white Democrats exercised a stranglehold on statewide offices and state legislatures throughout the region. Black men found in the wet movement at least one issue on which to ally with a powerful, white-dominated industry\xe2\x80\x94brewers and distillers\xe2\x80\x94to wield real political influence and protect Black suffrage. Even white supremacists in the wet coalition unwittingly helped to prop up interracial politics by protecting the alcohol lobby, which fought more to mobilize Black voters and to subvert Jim Crow poll taxes than any other white industry at the time. To oppose Gin Crow (southern prohibition) was to oppose Jim Crow, and that opposition was stronger and went longer than scholars have previously thought possible. Still, Black turnout eventually succumbed to voter-suppression tactics, dooming the region to Gin Crow.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Once statewide and national prohibition took effect, not only did law enforcement disproportionately target Black Americans for violations of dry laws, but white Protestant attacks against traditionally wet Catholics increased, particularly in the presidential election of 1928. The \xe2\x80\x9cSolid South\xe2\x80\x9d broke, with half of the formerly Confederate states joining with the GOP. The Democratic Party in the South had switched from \xe2\x80\x9cRebels, Rum, and Romanism\xe2\x80\x9d to rebels against rum and Romanism.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">While Black men lost suffrage, white women gained it. The Eighteenth and Nineteenth Amendments, for prohibition and women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage, had gone hand in hand, and many dry men granted women the vote mostly because they hoped women would never permit alcohol\xe2\x80\x99s return by the ballot box. However, the failure of prohibition to bring a promised utopia, particularly during the Great Depression, prompted respectable women to organize against prohibition. From the first woman elected governor, Texan Miriam \xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x9d Ferguson, to the Alabama organizer Pattie Ruffner Jacobs, southern women played leading roles in challenging assumptions that white women would always embrace prohibition.</p>\n<p class="x-txt">Unlike the contests over prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, repeal in the South came with little discussion of race and virtually no major Black involvement. Even the Republican Party in the South, once a staunch defender of Black rights, had turned from a multiracial \xe2\x80\x9cblack-and-tan\xe2\x80\x9d coalition to a lily-white institution. Gin Crow finally fell in part because it was no longer needed: Jim Crow laws had effectively disfranchised African Americans and imposed white supremacy. Before then, however, white drys had indelibly linked prohibition in the South with Jim Crow.</p>\n</body></html>\n'</p>
