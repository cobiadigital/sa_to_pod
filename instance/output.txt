I tinker with code and little machines. I used to work at a store that specializes in fixing computers and video game consoles. I ended up quitting to enjoy my summer since I don\'t need any money right now. Most people call me a nerd, but they never hesitate to ask for computer help. My little sister just turned 14 a couple of weeks ago, right after summer break started. She\'ll be starting 8th grade in the fall. Her name is Alyssa, she\'s very cute and she knows it. She has pastel pink wavy hair that comes down to her shoulders, piercing emerald eyes, and flawless Porcelain skin. She\'s very small, but if I\'m being honest she has the figue of a well developed woman, but almost like it was shrunk down. But here\'s the Catch, she\'s a total brat! She\'s totally cruel, but she\'s mom and dads favorite so she gets away with a lot of. She thinks that just because she\'s cute she deserves the world, but with a recent development I plan on changing that.We\'re on summer break, my father is a high-up at some tech company. Boring office junk as far as I can tell. So they\'ve gone on a cruise around the sea for the summer. I\'m in charge of watching Alyssa, and they\'ve stuffed my bank account to the brim for food, toys, activities, and whatever else my sister wants. "just call if you need more!" is what my mom said just before they sped away. Now I\'m stuck alone with my little sister. But like I said, I\'ve got a plan to keep her in check.</p>\n<p>Second week, day 1 alone with Alyssa: DawnStage 0</p>\n<p>Even though I\'m out of school now I can\'t help but wake up at 7 am, even without an alarm. My routine for the morning is usually wake up and then brush my teeth. I hate that morning taste in my mouth and when my teeth feel even a little gritty. So I walk into our shared bathroom and look at my side of the sink. My electric, very expensive, tooth brush is gone. I storm over to alyssas room, and bash on the door"Alright shit lord, where\'s my tooth brush" I hear groan from the other side.Her soft voice comes through the door, "how would I know, dingus? It\'s your toothbrush." She\'s such a pain in my ass."whatever, but if I don\'t find it soon you\'re dead." I can feel her sticking her tongue out at me as I walk away. Luckily I keep a spare tooth brush under the sink incase the battery dies or something in my other one.Another one of my tasks this summer is making sure I keep Alyssa fed. Sometimes she can be really picky and end up missing meals if we aren\'t careful. Chocolate chip pancakes with some strawberries is usually a safe bet for her, so I start to cook. I\'ve actually gotten pretty good at cooking! That\'ll definitely help me get a girlfriend in the future.After I finish making everything I call for her to come and eat, but I don\'t get a response. It\'s almost 8:30 she doesn\'t need to have fallen back asleep. So I grab her plate and walk upstairs to her room. As I get closer I hear something faintly, but I can\'t quite tell what it is. As I slowly inch closer to her door it gets louder and louder, still soft but easier to hear. And then I\'m right in front of her door, and it\'s unmistakable. Soft moans, whines and whimpers are seeping out through the door, along with a familiar buzzing sound. My entire face turns red, I can\'t tell if it\'s from embarrassment or anger. I set her plate down in front of her door and crouch to listen. She can\'t be doing what I think she\'s doing, right? I can hear the bed creaking, her voice is quivering and the moans are get faster and shorter. I can\'t seem to move away, I can\'t believe what I\'m hearing."something\'s... C-coming.." she whispers. I cover my mouth with my hand, I don\'t wanna listen anymore but if I move and she hears me I\'m dead. She\'s way too young to be doing something like this."I want it... I w-want it.. Please, please, please.. Gah~! Ahh haa... Oh my gosh..." after what sounds like her finish she pants for a few more moments before turning off the brush. I take my chance to dash back downstairs to eat my own breakfast. I text her that her plate is there and think to myself, I\'ll just get a new toothbrush.</p>\n<p>Second week, day 1 alone with Alyssa: AfternoonStage 0</p></mstts:express-as></prosody></voice></speak>', '<speak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="http://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" xmlns:emo="http://www.w3.org/2009/10/emotionml" version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US">\n                     <voice name="en-US-SaraNeural">\n                         <prosody rate="0%" pitch="0%"><mstts:express-as style="hopeful">\n<p>After that extremely awkward interaction this morning I stayed down in the living room. I was playing video games and I guess time just got away from me, because before I knew it Alyssa has plopped down next to me begging to go somewhere for lunch."pleeeeeeease! I\'m really really hungry!" she puts her little hands on my shoulder and rocks me back and forth."come on lamb, we\'ve got shit here you can make your self" out of the corner of my eye I can see her puppy dog eyes and puffed out cheeks"I told you not to call me that, now let\'s go out! The food here is boring!" I decide that ignoring Her was probably my best course of action. After a couple of minutes I start to feel bad."okay kid, I\'ll take us out right after I sav-" I\'m cut off by the TV going black. My jaw hangs open, an hour of progress just gone. I was too distracted to notice this little gremlin has gotten up and pushed the power button on my system."you absolute heathen... You better start running because I\'m about to end you" Alyssa looks me up and down."if you lay a finger on me daddy will kill you for real!" and she\'s not wrong there, so all I can do is swallow my anger.As I stand up a quickly I say "fine, go get dressed". Alyssa does a little victory dance before running upstairs. God she drives me insane, I can\'t wait to get some pay back.About ten minutes pass by and Alyssa is basically skipping down the stairs. She\'s wearing one of those shoulderless shirts, black short shorts, and black cat thigh highs. Her thighs are actually pretty plump for her age so you can see the elastic squeeze her skin."alright out you go, lamb. Get in the car." I\'m grabbing my keys and I feel a sudden sharp pain in my leg"ow ow ow! Jesus, what the hell, Alyssa?"Pinching my leg and with a smug look on her face she spits out "I said don\'t call me that!"i slap her hand away, "just get in car alright? You want food or not?" she runs out the door and into the car. Walking over to the drivers side I pull at the handle, locked. So I push the unlock on the key fob and pull again, still locked. I look up and Alyssa is busting a gut in the passenger seat. Once I manage to actually get in the car I turn to her."in the back, you know you\'re not allowed up front." shes staring at me like I just killed her first born."or you can sit up front And face dads fury when he gets back." and I immediately regret saying that."daddy wouldn\'t punish me! He\'d be mad at you for letting his precious little girl be in danger." smirking while she buckled her seat belt."so let\'s just do and say we didn\'t, kk?""you know, i really hate you sometimes." I pull the wheel to the left so we can back out."no one can hate me, I\'m too cute for that. At least that\'s what daddy always says." she leans over and gives me peck on the cheek.</p>\n<p>Second week, day 1 alone with Alyssa: NightStage 1</p></mstts:express-as></prosody></voice></speak>', '<speak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="http://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" xmlns:emo="http://www.w3.org/2009/10/emotionml" version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US">\n                     <voice name="en-US-SaraNeural">\n                         <prosody rate="0%" pitch="0%"><mstts:express-as style="hopeful">\n<p>After my shower I head to my bedroom and Alyssa takes the bathroom after me. In my bedroom I place myself at my desk and get to work. I\'ve been studying hypnosis. Things like hidden meanings in music, visual and auditory patterns, stuff like that. And with that information I\'ve been coding an app for my phone, and it\'s nearly finished. All I need is to test it! And I know the lucky little lamb that will be my first subject.I texted Alyssa to come to my room after her shower, that I wanted to show her something she might like. After about 45 minutes she traipses into my room in pink boy shorts and a Tight fitting blue tank top, with a blue and pink bunny logo on it."alrighty, I\'m here. But I\'m also tired so can you hurry up?"I motion her to sit on my bed. "sure thing, just put these headphones on And look at the screen. It\'s a music video." My little sister sighs and puts on the headphones, her ears are instantly filled with odd melodies and patterns. Lights and colors flash on the screen and her pupils Dilate. After about three minutes I take the headphones off of her."well? What did you think?" I pull up the control panel part of the app."it was really weird, and my head hurts now. I don\'t think I like it. I um, I think I\'m gonna go to bed now." as she stands up I select the option for verbal suggestions, nothing too serious."why not sit Back down?" she stops abruptly and walks back to the bed, and sits down."h-hey, ya know what, I think I\'m gonna hang out a little longer." I cant help but laugh, I\'m elated that this actually worked! But I need to see how much control I have. Under the hypnosis she should be far more likely to answer any question I ask, I look back to her."so, do you hate me?""what? Of course I don\'t, I love my big brother..." she blushes profusely and looks away. I sit down next to her,"Alyssa? Are you not feeling well?" she squirms a bit in place."I dont know.. My arms feel like, really really heavy, and my head is full of Like, all these fuzzy bits" I gaze into her innocent eyes, ideas are racing through my mind of what I can make her do."maybe you\'re just tired, lamb." That\'s sure to get a reaction out of her and I\'ll be able to adjust her behavior accordingly. The brat stomps her foot and starts reaching to pinch my arm."dont call me th-" I quickly interrupt her."stop." Her words get stuck in her throat and her tiny hand pulls back a little bit, she looks a little confused. The app has different modes, verbal control, manual control, and total control. Alyssa is in verbal control right now, which means I can only really suggest things. If she really wanted to she could ignore a command, but this way I can make her question what she\'s really feeling or thinking. Manual control would just scare her, and she wouldn\'t remember anything if I used total control."I remember you told me you liked being called lamb, you said it made you feel sweet and cute." Alyssa looks down for a moment then back to me."Did I really say that? I could have sworn... But now that you say that, I guess it does sound pretty cute." This is working better than I could have possibly dreamed!"You seem tired, lamb. You should go to sleep soon so you\'ll feel better." She\'s already following orders well so a simple one like this should be fine. Alyssa yawns and her eyes look tired, she looks so unbelievably cute when she\'s not being a menace."you\'re right, I wanna feel better real soon. I\'m gonna sleep now.""sounds good girly, I\'ll see you in the morning." She then proceeds to immediately fall asleep in my bed. Christ, I guess I have to be more specific with suggestions and commands. Now she\'s sleeping in my bed, what am I supposed to do? She looks so innocent and vulnerable just laying there. I pick her up to move her back to her own bed, but the second I\'m holding her I feel a strange warmth in my chest. I look down at her, she\'s softly breathing. My younger sister is so little, so fragile, and a lot less bratty. Honestly she\'s absolutely adorable. All I want to do is hold her all night, so thats exactly what I\'m going to do. I lay down on my side, spooning her little body. She\'s so warm and her hair is soft and smells like green apple. Once I\'ve pulled the covers over us it isn\'t long before I drift off to sleep, too. </p>\n<p>Second week, day 2 alone with Alyssa: DawnStage 1</p></mstts:express-as></prosody></voice></speak>', '<speak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="http://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" xmlns:emo="http://www.w3.org/2009/10/emotionml" version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US">\n                     <voice name="en-US-SaraNeural">\n                         <prosody rate="0%" pitch="0%"><mstts:express-as style="hopeful">\n<p>My eyes slowly open and I look at my clock, 6:53 am. Right on time, as always. I lift the covers and see my little sister, oh God I forgot she was here. If she wakes up in my arms there will absolutely be hell to pay. As gently as I possibly can I shift her to free my arm, I notice an uncomfortable expression on her face. My only guess is she\'s about to wake up so quickly and quietly stride out of my room to our bathroom. I\'m worried about how she\'ll react to waking up in my bed.After I finish brushing my teeth I head downstairs to get some clean clothes out of the dryer so I can shower. As I\'m heading back into the bathroom Alyssa walks out if my room, and starts coming towards me. I dart into the bathroom and shut the door. I\'m hoping that she\'ll just walk back to her room, but my hopes are shattered as her little fist hits the door."um, why did I just wake up in your bed?" What am I even supposed to say?"uhhhh, what do you remember?" nice one Corbin, that\'s super inconspicuous."I dunno, I remember getting ready for bed but then you wanted to show me something. I remember falling asleep but it\'s all really.. Fuzzy." alright, think quick. Okay, here goes nothing."oh right, I remember now! I showed you a video and you went to bed. Halfway through the night you had a nightmare and asked if you could sleep in my room with me. Being the saint that I am, I let you"There\'s a pause from the other side if door. Shit, did I go too far? I guess it wasnt that believable. God, I\'m screwed."oh you\'re right, I just remembered. Guess I was still sleepy".Success! I absolutely cannot believe she bought it."anyways, get out of the bathroom. I wanna shower". Typical of her bratty self, but with a little suggestion she\'ll be patient."not now lamb, I\'m about to shower". Here comes the \'yes big brother, I\'ll wait\'. I\'m smiling smugly until."what? No, I wanna do it now. Get out Now before I call daddy!". I can\'t believe my ears, I know she can disobey if she wants to. But this was a simple command, and her response was immediate."get lost short stack, I was here first. Just go use the one in mom and dads room". She\'s not gonna budge."no! This one\'s closer to the water heater, if we shower at the same time I\'ll just get cold water! Get out!" My only response is the loud click from locking the door."I\'m dialing daddys number right now, he\'s gonna change the Wi-Fi password and he\'ll only tell me." Dammit all, she\'s got me here."okay fine, you win. Brat." I gather my clothes and unlock the door. As soon as she hears that she\'s already pushing past me to get inside."thanks, butt munch~!" she sticks her tongue out as she slams the door. God, She\'s a massive pain. I guess the hypnosis wears off after sleeping for awhile. Or it just has a set time limit. I\'m going to have to get her to watch that video again somehow, but I have no idea how I\'m going to achieve that. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Second week, day 2 alone with Alyssa:NoonStage 1</p></mstts:express-as></prosody></voice></speak>', '<speak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="http://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" xmlns:emo="http://www.w3.org/2009/10/emotionml" version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US">\n                     <voice name="en-US-SaraNeural">\n                         <prosody rate="0%" pitch="0%"><mstts:express-as style="hopeful">\n<p>I\'ve been reading this science fiction book recently, it\'s actually what gave me the idea to hypnotize my sister. These aliens use this poison to to mold how humans think, so they\'ll work for them and what not. The book isn\'t very well written, but it\'s a good concept. But closer to the end the aliens start killing and eating the humans, I don\'t plan on doing anything cruel or unusual. I just want the cute and loving little sister I deserve. She\'ll finally do her own chores instead of pushing them on me. Alyssa, you may be cute but that doesn\'t excuse you from work. Actually, I guess it does. She could sleep with whoever to get jobs and good pay. I don\'t know why but that thought just made me feel really angry, like someone is taking my territory. As I start to get upset over the idea I just made up, Alyssa comes down the stairs to greet me. She\'s wearing fishnet stockings, a red pleated skirt, and a back tee shirt with a white cat on it, With a black and white striped long sleeve shirt under it, both tucked into her skirt. She looks really really cute, she doesn\'t even wear much makeup. Just winged eye liner and a little blush. I\'d say she\'d make a great girl friend for some boy, if she wasn\'t such a brat."Cooooorbin, I wanna go to the mall! Can we please go, Im meeting some friends!" she\'s bouncing energetically. I set my book down and look at her."I dunno, I don\'t think I\'m feeling so generous after you kicked me out of the bathroom this morning." she smirks and hugs my arm."You know you don\'t really have a say, daddy already said you had to. Plus, what kind of big brother gets pushed around by his little sister? You should pretend it was all your idea!" she has a smile on her little face, the kind that screams "dance monkey". I put my hands up in defeat."Okay okay, I surrender. Go get my keys." She sprints up the stairs and comes back down a few seconds later, jingling the whole way. We get in the car and head out. As we pull onto the highway to get to the mall Alyssas phone connects to the cars Bluetooth. She starts blasting this awful Asian music."oh my God, what is this? It\'s garbage." I reach for the volume dial but slaps my hand away."it\'s called k-pop, and it\'s really good! You\'re just too old to get it." she looks like I\'ve actually hurt her feelings."I wasn\'t gonna change it, just lower the volume a bit okay?" I give her quick kind look."F-fine. only turn down it down a little, okay?" I turn the dial enough so she can still hear, but it\'s less annoying."no problem little lamb. Oh and by the way, I\'m not that much older than you!" Alyssa giggles and kicks her legs a little."are you kidding me? You\'re basically a fossil!""Pfft! You\'re Incorrigible! Dads like a million years older than both of us, combined!" we drive the rest of the way joking around and listening to awful music.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Second week, day 2 alone with Alyssa:AfternoonStage 1</p>\n<p> </p></mstts:express-as></prosody></voice></speak>', '<speak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="http://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" xmlns:emo="http://www.w3.org/2009/10/emotionml" version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US">\n                     <voice name="en-US-SaraNeural">\n                         <prosody rate="0%" pitch="0%"><mstts:express-as style="hopeful">\n<p>Once we get to the mall we\'re both starving, so Alyssa suggests that we get food at the food court while we wait for her friends. As we finish up she looks at me with a little discomfort."so um... Once my friends get her can you like, not walk with us? It would be kinda embarrassing if my big brother tagged along." and honestly I\'m little shocked, I thought we having a pretty good time together."I can\'t just leave you alone to wander the mall, dad would kill me." as I\'m lecturing her I see two girls and one guy walking towards us."and you\'re here with a guy? You\'ve gotta be kidding." she stands up and giggles."sounds like you\'re jealous to me~" I can feel my ears and cheeks turn bright red."don\'t worry, Corbin. He\'s just a friend. And I just meant you should follow kinda far behind us.""right, cool, got it." she nods and the trots over to her friends. They start talking and laughing, then she hugs the guy. I don\'t know why but I honestly do feel really jealous. They start heading towards some makeup store, so I follow behind them then stand outside the door while they shop around. We go store to store and not a single one of them will even look at me.After about an hour they head over to a clothes store, M and H, Alyssa\'s favorite. Since this store is pretty popular there are actual cushioned couches outside, so I take my seat and prepare to wait. The whole front of the store is made of glass, so I can see Alyssa and her friends goofing around for half an hour. They\'re all grabbing clothes and Laughing, eventually they move to the dressing rooms. After a few moments I get a text from Alyssa,"hey Corbin! ^_^ I\'m gonna send some pictures. Let me know which outfits you like! ฅ\'ω\'ฅ" And honestly I didn\'t think much about it, until the pictures started to come in. She looked so developed in these outfits. Short skirts, tiny tops, loose dresses. Not to mention the poses. I couldn\'t believe how absolutely cute she was. I almost instinctively save all of the pictures. Then one pops up of her in lacey pink underwear, but no pose."uh, did you mean to send that last one??""oh oops! ^ω^ Sorry, that was for Mayu! She told me to try it on." My hands are shaking a little bit and My breath is shallow."well?? Which outfits do you like?? :3" the new text snaps me awake."the back skirt with the white puffy top is pretty Cute, and I like the grey hoodie, yellow shorts, and tights outfit.""kk! ^ω^ thanks for the help! Now I know what to not get :p""aw come on, those two were the cutest out of everything" a couple of minutes go by, no response. I keep going back to our messages and looking at the last picture she sent, I can\'t stop stealing glances at it. Her face is so innocent, but that\'s in stark contrast to the rest her.After about 20 more minutes they all walk out of the store and out into the middle of the hallway."bye Alyssa! Thanks for hanging out with us! We\'ll talk to you soon!" they wave good bye and the guy goes to her hug her, and I\'m suddenly feeling my ears go red and I\'ve got bad taste in my mouth. They hug and Alyssa walks over to me with a bunch of bags, she sets them on the floor in front of me and sits down."uggggggh my legs feel like jelly!" she leans against me and sets her head on my shoulder. It\'s nice to have her rest against me, but I\'m still mad."so, how was it? Have fun with your boyfriend?" I try my best not to sound angry or anything. Alyssa laughs a little."you really think I would date him? Hes a total skater nerd""I thought girls liked skaters?""maybe Mayu does, she has a total crush on him! But I like smart boys." smart boys huh? Hearing that makes me feel a little better."well little lamb, it\'s nearly dinner time. What do you want? Wcdonalds?" she points at her mouth and makes a throwing up noise."no way, let\'s get Vendys! That\'s my favorite fast food place""come on, you know I hate vendys." she looks at me with big, innocent, watery eyes."those puppy dog eyes won\'t work on me." Alyssa hugs my arm as tight as she can, and don\'t think she\'s old enough to know that she\'s pushing her tiny chest against me."okay, okay! Y-you win, please let go now." she let\'s go of me and smiles that smug smile of hers, when we get home she\'s totally going under hypnosis. That brat is going to be sweet and obedient.

I\'m on my computer for a bit and I see a pretty lewd image of one of my waifus from my favorite anime. She\'s a loli, but she has the body type of an adult, so I\'m not too worried about it. As soon as I think that I\'m reminded of that picture Alyssa accidentally sent. I pull it up and stare for a moment, admiring how cute her face is, her short Pink hair, her beautiful pale skin which gets pink near her joints, cheeks, and tummy. Before I realize it I\'m fighting the urge to masturbate to this picture of my little sister. I see her face, and I see my demon of a little sister. But I look at her body, and I see this tiny, vulnerable... No, I can\'t. Not to her, not to my own sister... I take a screenshot of the message and crop off her face, then I slide my pants off and start stroking myself, I couldn\'t help myself, her body is so small, but she\'s so developed. She doesn\'t look like a middle schooler, she looks like a petite 20 year old, Her chest is small but her curves are there. Even though I cropped her face out of the picture I know it\'s her, and for some reason every time I think that it feels better. Fuck it, I swap back over to the original picture and stare at her adorable face. I\'m so absorbed into her that it\'s too late before I notice that Alyssa has come into my room, she gets right behind the chair before speaking."what\'cha doin\'?" she spins the chair around and catches me red handed. Dick in one hand, her picture in the other."is... Is this the picture I accidentally sent you? W-what are you doing?" her face is a mixture of shock and disgust."I uh, it\'s not what you think it! I have a really good explanation!" I pull up the hypnosis app and go to the video I made."you sicko! I\'m calling daddy!" she\'s storms out my room, I can hear her dialing. I\'m freaking out, what do I do? I\'m gonna die, for real! I go to the command section of the hypnosis app And mash the manual control button, but I don\'t think it worked. I\'m almost certain she\'d have to watch the video again. I scramble to pull up my pants and run after her, I get to her room and I fling her door open. She\'s just standing beside her bed."Alyssa? Hey, look it really wasn\'t what it looked like..." no response. Is she in manual control mode? She must be, I can\'t imagine another reason why she isn\'t selling my soul to dad right now. I notice her phone laying on the bed in the middle of a call, contact name \'Daddy <3\'. With shaky hands I grab the phone and lift it to my ear."hello? Dad? It\'s Corbin.""yes, hello, why did you call me on Alyssa\'s phone? Is there a problem?" oh thank God, she hadn\'t said anything yet."no! I was helping her to bed, she\'s not feeling well today. Must have called you by accident!""right well, please try not to bother me again unless it\'s an emergency, or you need more money." typical."yes sir, sorry for the inconvenience. I hope you and mom have a good night." click... Beep, beep, beep.I set Alyssas phone down and look at her, she\'s completely still. I wave my hand in front of her face, no response. She\'s definitely in manual control mode. I pace back and forth in front of her. I guess she only has to watch it once, but sleeping breaks the connection to the app. Well here she is, completely under my control. I can feel my cock harden at the thought. Right here, completely unaware of what\'s going on. I lower my pants and begin to rub myself again. My breath is shaky and my heart is pounding out of my chest. If I woke her up now, she\'d still wanna call dad. So my hands are tied. What can I do other than finish what I started? I think about that picture of her in nothing but underwear, her stomach looked so soft and warm. I can\'t help but walk up her, untuck her shirt from her skirt, and lift it off of her. Here before me, my shirtless little her sister, her tummy completely exposed. I sit down on her desk chair to keep touching myself, then it hits me. She\'s basically asleep, I can do whatever I\'d like to. She\'s short, her head reaches just barely under my ribs, which means her tummy is at the perfect height for what I\'m about to do. I slowly walk up to my sister, she looks so small and cute. You could probably hear my heart beats from across the house. I very carefully tap her shoulder, seeing if she\'ll wake up if I touch her. She let\'s out a small breath of air but still, her eyes are empty. I basically hug her, my cock gently rubbing against her tummy. Even with a slight touch it feels incredibly soft. I slowly thrust forward, moving my tip up her center, passing over her navel, and pressing my member between us. God, she\'s so warm too. For a couple of minutes I very gingerly run myself up and down her tummy, pre cum is trailing in my path. I can\'t hold back anymore. With one hand I grab the back of my little sisters head And press it against my chest, I use my other arm to wrap around her back, pressing her stomach against my cock, and I start thrusting.</mstts:express-as></p></prosody></voice></speak>', '<speak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="http://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" xmlns:emo="http://www.w3.org/2009/10/emotionml" version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US">\n                     <voice name="en-US-SaraNeural">\n                         <prosody rate="0%" pitch="0%"><mstts:express-as style="hopeful"><p> She doesn\'t make a sound, but I don\'t care. All I can think about is how I\'m tummy fucking my 14 year old little sister. I\'m getting closer and closer with movement if my hips."fuck Alyssa, your tummy is so perfect.. I\'m gonna cum all over it.. That\'s a good little lamb... I\'m gonna cum on my little sister..." I grunt as I thrust into her one more time, cumming all over her stomach with one of the biggest orgasms I\'ve ever had. I hold her body close to me for a little longer after I\'ve climaxed. Pulling away from her, I stare at my work. Strings of my cum keep us connected, Her tummy is red from where I\'ve humped her, and covered in my cum. It drips down onto her skirt and bedroom floor. I grab a few tissues and clean her up best I can.I do everything to hide what I\'ve done, I ever rub her stomach down with hot and soapy water. I put her into some pajamas and carry her to her back bedroom. After setting Alyssa down and covering her up I head back to my room. I toss and turn for 15 minutes and then I think to myself, I want her here. I want to hold her as I fall asleep. So I walk back into her and scoop her up, holding her close me. She really does look like an angel when she\'s asleep, and once she wakes up she won\'t remember a thing that happened last night. I bring her back to my room and we sleep together, another night of the best sleep I\'ve ever had.</p>\n<p> </p></mstts:express-as></prosody></voice></speak>']
